         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that when users navigate sequentially
               through content, they encounter information in an order that is consistent with the
               meaning of the content and can be operated from the keyboard. This reduces confusion
               by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different
               orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, moving through
               components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical
               relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this Success Criterion.
               
            </p>
            <p>The way that sequential navigation order is determined in Web content is defined by
               the technology of the content. For example, simple HTML defines sequential navigation
               via the notion of tabbing order. Dynamic HTML may modify the navigation sequence using
               scripting along with the addition of a tabindex attribute to allow focus to additional
               elements. If no scripting or tabindex attributes are used, the navigation order is
               the order that components appear in the content stream. (See HTML 4.01 Specification,
               section 17.11, "Giving focus to an element").
               
            </p>
            <p>An example of keyboard navigation that is not the sequential navigation addressed
               by this Success Criterion is using arrow key navigation to traverse a tree component.
               The user can use the up and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing
               the right arrow key may expand a node, then using the down arrow key, will move into
               the newly expanded nodes. This navigation sequence follows the expected sequence for
               a tree control - as additional items get expanded or collapsed, they are added or
               removed from the navigation sequence.
               
            </p>
            <p>The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order
               (see Success Criterion 1.3.2) as long as the user can still understand and operate
               the Web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content,
               the focus order may match any of them. However, when the order of a particular presentation
               differs from the programmatically determined reading order, users of one of these
               presentations may find it difficult to understand or operate the Web page. Authors
               should carefully consider all these users as they design their Web pages.
               
            </p>
            <p>For example, a screen reader user interacts with the programmatically determined reading
               order, while a sighted keyboard user interacts with the visual presentation of the
               Web page. Care should be taken so that the focus order makes sense to both of these
               sets of users and does not appear to either of them to jump around randomly. 
               
            </p>

               <li>Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and
                  operability only when navigation sequences affect meaning and operability.

                  meaning and operability.

               <li>On a web page that contains a tree of interactive controls, the user can use the up
                  and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing the right arrow
                  key expands a node, then using the down arrow key moves into the newly expanded nodes.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A Web page implements modeless dialogs via scripting. When the trigger button is activated,
                  a dialog opens. The interactive elements in the dialog are inserted in the focus order
                  immediately after the button. When the dialog is open, the focus order goes from the
                  button to the elements of the dialog, then to the interactive element following the
                  button. When the dialog is closed, the focus order goes from the button to the following
                  element.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A Web page implements modal dialogs via scripting. When the trigger button is activated,
                  a dialog opens and focus is set to the first interactive element in the dialog. As
                  long as the dialog is open, focus is limited to the elements of the dialog. When the
                  dialog is dismissed, focus returns to the button or the element following the button.

                     the main body content, and styled with CSS to appear on the left hand side of the
                     page. This is done to allow focus to move to the main body content first without requiring
                     tabIndex attributes or JavaScript.

                           CSS positioning would. More complex positioning examples may or may not preserve meaning

                  <p>A company's Web site includes a form that collects marketing data and allows users
                     to subscribe to several newsletters published by the company. The section of the form
                     for collecting marketing data includes fields such as name, street address, city,
                     state or province, and postal code. Another section of the form includes several checkboxes
                     so that users can indicate newsletters they want to receive. However, the tab order
                     for the form skips between fields in different sections of the form, so that focus
                     moves from the name field to a checkbox, then to the street address, then to another
                     checkbox.
