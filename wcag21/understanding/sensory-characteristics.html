         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics" style="font-weight: bold;">1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics</a> (Level A): Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access instructions
               for using the content, even when they cannot perceive shape or size or use information
               about spatial location or orientation. 
               Some content relies on knowledge of the shape or position of objects that are not
               available from the structure of the content (for example, "round button" or "button
               to the right"). 
               Some users with disabilities are not able to perceive shape or position due to the
               nature of the assistive technologies they use. 
               This Success Criterion requires that additional information be provided to clarify
               instructions that are dependent on this kind of information.         
               </p>
            <p>Providing information using shape and/or location, however, is an effective method
               for many users including those with cognitive limitations.
               This provision should not discourage those types of cues as long as the information
               is also provided in other ways.
               </p>
            <p>In some languages, it is commonly understood that "above" refers to the content previous
               to that point in the content and "below" refers to the content after that point. In
               such languages, if the content being referenced is in the appropriate place in the
               reading order and the references are unambiguous, statements such as "choose one of
               the links below" or "all of the above" would conform to this Success Criterion. 
               </p>
            <p>WCAG was designed to apply only to controls that were displayed on a web page. The
               intent was to avoid describing controls solely via references to visual or auditory
               cues. When applying this to instructions for operating physical hardware controls
               (e.g. a web kiosk with dedicated content), tactile cues on the hardware might be described
               (e.g. the arrow shaped key, the round key on the right side). This success criterion
               is not intended to prevent the use of tactile cues in instructions.

                  instructions if they rely only on a description of the shape and/or location of content.
                  Providing additional information in any instructions other than shape and/or location
                  will allow users to understand the instructions even if they cannot perceive shape
                  and/or location.

                     An online multi-page survey uses a link implemented as a green arrow icon placed
                     in the lower right hand corner of the content to move from one survey page to the
                     next. The arrow is clearly labeled with "Next" and the instructions state, "To move
                     to the next section of the survey, select the green arrow icon labeled 'Next' in the
                     lower right corner below the last survey question." 
                     The instruction uses positioning and color to help identify the icon; 
                     the instruction does not rely on these sensory characteristics since it also refers
                     to the label, so it passes this criterion.
