            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>If all 
               <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#dfn-functionality" target="terms">functionality</a> can be achieved using the keyboard, it can be accomplished by keyboard users, by
               speech input (which creates keyboard input), by mouse (using on-screen keyboards),
               and by a wide variety of assistive technologies that create simulated keystrokes as
               their output. No other input form has this flexibility or is universally supported
               and operable by people with different disabilities, as long as the keyboard input
               is not time-dependent.
               
            </p>
            <p>Note that providing universal keyboard input does not mean that other types of input
               should not be supported. Optimized speech input, optimized mouse/pointer input, etc.,
               are also good. The key is to provide keyboard input and control as well.
               
            </p>
            <p>Some devices do not have native keyboardsâ€”for example, a PDA or cell phone. If these
               devices have a Web browsing capability, however, they will have some means of generating
               text or "keystrokes". This guideline uses the term "
               <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#dfn-keyboard-interface" target="terms">keyboard interface</a>" to acknowledge that Web content should be controlled from keystrokes that may come
               from a keyboard, keyboard emulator, or other hardware or software that generates keyboard
               or text input.

            <h2>Advisory Techniques</h2>
            <p>Specific techniques for meeting each Success Criterion for this guideline are listed
               in the understanding sections for each Success Criterion (listed below). If there
               are techniques, however, for addressing this guideline that do not fall under any
               of the success criteria, they are listed here. These techniques are not required or
               sufficient for meeting any success criteria, but can make certain types of Web content
               more accessible to more people.

                           to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications
