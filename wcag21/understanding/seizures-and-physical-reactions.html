            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>Some people with seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by flashing visual
               content. Most people are unaware that they have this disorder until it strikes. In
               1997, a cartoon on television in Japan sent over 700 children to the hospital, including
               about 500 who had seizures. Warnings do not work well because they are often  missed,
               especially by children
               who may in fact not be able to read them.
               
            </p>
            <p>The objective of this guideline is to ensure that content that is marked as conforming
               to WCAG 2.0 avoids the types of flash that are most likely to cause seizure when viewed
               even for a second or two.

            <h2>Advisory Techniques</h2>
            <p>Specific techniques for meeting each Success Criterion for this guideline are listed
               in the understanding sections for each Success Criterion (listed below). If there
               are techniques, however, for addressing this guideline that do not fall under any
               of the success criteria, they are listed here. These techniques are not required or
               sufficient for meeting any success criteria, but can make certain types of Web content
               more accessible to more people.
