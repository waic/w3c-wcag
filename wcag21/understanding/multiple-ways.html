            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make it possible for users to locate content
               in a manner that best meets their needs. Users may find one technique easier or more
               comprehensible to use than another.
               
            </p>
            <p>Even small sites should provide users some means of orientation. For a three or four
               page site, with all pages linked from the home page, it may be sufficient simply to
               provide links from and to the home page where the links on the home page can also
               serve as a site map.

               <li>Providing an opportunity to navigate sites in more than one manner can help people
                  find information faster. Users with visual impairments may find it easier to navigate
                  to the correct part of the site by using a search, rather than scrolling through a
                  large navigation bar using a screen magnifier or screen reader. A person with cognitive
                  disabilities may prefer a table of contents or site map that provides an overview
                  of the site rather than reading and traversing through several Web pages. Some users
                  may prefer to explore the site in a sequential manner, moving from Web page to Web
                  page in order to best understand the concepts and layout.
