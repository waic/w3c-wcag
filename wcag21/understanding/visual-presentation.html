            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually  rendered text is
               presented in such a manner that it can be perceived  without its layout interfering
               with its readability. People with some  cognitive, language and learning disabilities
               and some low vision users  cannot perceive the text and/or lose their reading place
               if the text is presented in a  manner that is difficult for them to read. 
               
            </p>
            <p>People with some visual or cognitive disabilities need to be  able to select the color
               of text and the color of the background. They  sometimes choose combinations that
               seem unintuitive to someone without  that disability. Sometimes these combinations
               have very low contrast.  Sometimes only very specific color combinations work for
               them. Control of color or other aspects of text presentation makes a huge difference
               to their comprehension.  
               
            </p>
            <p>For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long  lines of text can become
               a significant barrier. They have trouble  keeping their place and following the flow
               of text. Having a narrow  block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to
               the next line  in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs (40 if
               CJK), where glyphs are the element of writing in the writing system for the text.
               Studies
               have shown that Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters are approximately twice
               as wide as non-CJK characters when both types of characters are displayed with characteristics
               that achieve the same readability, so the maximum line width for CJK characters is
               half that of non-CJK characters.
               
            </p>
            <p>People with some cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track text where the
               lines are close together. Providing extra space between lines and paragraphs allows
               them to better track the next line and to recognize when they have reached the end
               of a paragraph. It is best if there are several different options, for instance, space-and-a-half
               and double spacing for line spacing. By space and a half within paragraphs we mean
               that top of one line is 150% further from the top of the line below it than would
               be true when the text is 'single spaced' (the default spacing for the font). By Paragraph
               spacing that is 1.5 times larger than the line spacing we mean that the spacing from
               the top of the last line of 1 paragraph is 250% farther from the Top of the first
               line of the next paragraph (i.e., that there is a blank line between the two paragraphs
               that is 150% of the single space blank line). 
               
            </p>
            <p>People with certain cognitive disabilities have problems  reading text that is both
               left and right justified. The uneven spacing  between words in fully justified text
               can cause "rivers of white" space  to run down the page making reading difficult and
               in some cases  impossible. Text justification can also cause words to be spaced  closely
               together, so that it is difficult for them to locate word  boundaries. 
               
            </p>
            <p>The resizing provision ensures that visually rendered text (text characters that have
               been displayed so that they can  be seen [vs. text characters that are still in data
               form such as  ASCII]) can be scaled successfully without requiring  that the user
               scroll left and right to see all of the content. When the  content has been authored
               so that this is possible, the content is said  to reflow. This permits people with
               low vision and people with  cognitive disabilities to increase the size of the text
               without  becoming disoriented. 
               
            </p>
            <p>The scaling of content is primarily a user agent  responsibility. User agents that
               satisfy UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1 allow  users to configure text scale. The author's
               responsibility is to create  Web content that does not prevent the user agent from
               scaling the  content and that allows the reflow of the content within the current
               width of the viewport. See 
               <a href="resize-text">1.4.2: Resize text</a> for additional discussion of resizing text. 
               
            </p>
            <p>The horizontal scrolling requirement is not intended to apply to small-screen devices
               where long words may be displayed on a single line and require users to scroll horizontally.
               For the purposes of this requirement, authors should ensure that content meets this
               requirement on standard desktop/laptop displays with the browser window maximized.
               Since people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely
               on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop
               display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.
               
            </p>
            <p>Wrapping should always be possible as long as words are not so long that a single
               word is more than half the width of a full screen. Very long URIs may run off the
               side of an enlarged screen, but they would not be considered text
               for "reading" and, therefore, would not violate this provision.
               
            </p>
            <p>This provision does not mean that a user would never need to use horizontal scrolling.
               It only means that they would not need to use horizontal scrolling back and forth
               to read a line of text. For example, if a page consisted of two equal sized columns
               of text, it would automatically meet this provision. Enlarging the page would mean
               that the first column was completely on screen and the user could just scroll vertically
               down the page to read it. To read the second column, they would horizontally scroll
               to the right, where the right hand column would then fit entirely within the width
               of the screen, and read that column without further horizontal scrolling.

            <p>This Success Criterion helps low vision users by letting them see  text without distracting
               presentational features. It lets them  configure text in ways that will be easier
               for them to see by letting  them control the color and size of blocks of text.
