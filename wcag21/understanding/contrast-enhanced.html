            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and
               its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do
               not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,
               hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading
               performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast
               somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way
               that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will
               also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.
               
            </p>
            <p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random
               words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted
               without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this
               criterion. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.
               The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to
               use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of
               pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large
               enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the
               Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large
               Print under 
               <a href="#visual-audio-contrast7-resources-head">Resources</a>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but,
               except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are
               so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy
               or thin fonts is included.

                  <p>The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
                     metrics as the user agent does when evaluating this success criterion. Point sizes
                     are based on the CSS pt size as defined in 
                     <a href="">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between sizes in points and CSS pixels is 1pt = 1.333px, therefore 14pt
                     and 18pt are equivalent to approximately 18.5px and 24px.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>When fonts have anti-aliasing applied to make them look smoother, they can lose darkness
                     or lightness.  Thus, the actual contrast can be reduced. Thicker stem widths will
                     reduce this effect (thin fonts could have the full stem lightened rather than just
                     the ends). Using larger fonts and testing for legibility in user agents with font
                     smoothing turned on is recommended.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities
                     (ex. 72 PPI or 96 PPI), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an image editing
                     application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.
                     When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the
                     resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the
                     default size for body text as rendered by the browser.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <p>The previously-mentioned contrast requirements for text also apply to
               images of text (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image
               format) as stated in Success Criterion 1.4.5
               
               
               
            </p>
            <p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be
               understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include
               a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be
               invisible to all users. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated
               in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content
               in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are
               not included in the exception.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that
               contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate
               pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text
               in order to get a particular look. 
               
            </p>
            <p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content
               presented in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information.
               Content presented in this manner should also have good contrast to ensure that more
               users can access the information.

               <h3>Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</h3>
               
               
               
               <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]
                  for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in Success Criterion 1.4.3
                  to account for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity,
                  congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that
                  typically accompanies aging.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable
                  contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding
                  that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity
                  loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast
                  ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1.  Following
                  analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity
                  would require contrast of about 7:1.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital
                  and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than
                  for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are
                  different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing
                  effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not
                  feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast
                  that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution
                  is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.
                  The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without
                  regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength
                  colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.
                  (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more
                  information see [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994]]

               <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the
                  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
                  to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is
                  commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]]
                  
                  
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the
                  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
                  to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually
                  use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies
                  usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).
                  The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity
                  experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides
                  contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.

               <p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be

                  light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would

               <li>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with
                  its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency
                  that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio
                  between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person
                  does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who
                  see no color.

                     <p>For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
                        to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
                        background color is specified, then white is assumed.

                        color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
                        be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
                        color is specified when a background color is specified.

                     <p>The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
                        size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text
                        fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
                        of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
                        would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
                        relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
                        The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
                        metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
                        have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.

                     <p>When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
                        browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
                        a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
                        be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
                        the default sizes in a similar fashion.
