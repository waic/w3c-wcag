            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this success criterion is to make it easier for users to prevent accidental
               or erroneous pointer input. People with various disabilities can inadvertently initiate
               touch or mouse events with unwanted results. Each of the following subsections roughly
               aligns with the bullets of this Success Criterion, and outlines a means of allowing
               users to cancel pointer operations.
            </p>
            <section id="up-event-activation-or-completion">
               			
               <h3>Up-Event activation or completion</h3>
               			
               <p>The most accessible way to incorporate pointer cancellation is to make activation
                  occur on the up-event.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Up-event activation refers to the activation of a target when the pointer is released.
                  In a touchscreen interaction, when the finger touches a target, the up-event activation
                  only occurs when the finger is lifted while still being within the target boundary.
                  Similarly in mouse interaction, the up-event occurs when the mouse button is released
                  while the cursor is still within the boundary of the initial target set when the mouse
                  button was pressed.
               </p>
               
               <p>Authors can reduce the problem of users inadvertently triggering an action by using
                  generic platform activation/click events that activate functionality on the up-event.
                  For example, the <code>click</code> event in JavaScript triggers on release of the primary mouse button, and is an example
                  of an implicit up-event. Despite its name, the <code>click</code> event is device-independent and also works for touch and keyboard interaction.
               </p>
               
               <p>The preference for up-events is implicit in the Success Criterion wording of the first
                  bullet: <q>The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function.</q> Authors meet the first bullet by using only the up-event.
               </p>

            <section id="up-event-abort-or-undo">
               
               <h3>Up-Event Abort or Undo</h3>
               
               <p>Where the interaction is equivalent to a simple "click", up-event activation has a
                  built-in ability to cancel. There is a distinction between when someone touches a
                  screen and when they remove their finger. Similarly, in mouse interaction, there is
                  a difference between pressing and releasing the mouse button. When activation occurs
                  only as the pointer is released, users have the opportunity to Abort (cancel) the
                  activation. Users who have difficulty accurately using a mouse or touchscreen benefit
                  greatly from this basic behaviour. They normally receive visual feedback when an item
                  is pressed. If they discover they have selected the wrong item, they can cancel the
                  action by moving their pointer or finger away from the target before releasing.
               </p>
               			
               
               <p>For more complex interactions, such as drag and drop, the down- and up-events may
                  initiate and end a series of actions to complete a process. For example, with drag
                  and drop, the item may be:
               </p>
               
               <ol>
                  
                  <li>selected with a press (down-event),</li>
                  
                  <li>moved to a new location, while still being depressed, and</li>
                  
                  <li>released (up-event) to conclude the drop action.</li>
                  
               </ol>
               
               <p>In such a complex action, the need for an Abort or Undo function increases. Designers
                  may elect to confirm the move through something like a confirmation dialog or an undo
                  button, giving the user the ability to Undo the process just completed. Alternatively,
                  the ability to Abort the action can be acheived if, before completing step 3, the
                  user returns the selected item to its original location and concludes the process
                  there. If other parts of the screen disallow a move, the user can conclude the drag
                  and drop there, effectively nullifying the operation.
               </p>

               <h3>Up Reversal</h3>
               
               <p>In other interactions, the down-event may trigger a behaviour which can be reversed
                  when the up-event concludes. Examples of this include press-and-hold actions such
                  as where a transient popup appears (or a video plays) when the user presses on an
                  object (down-event), but the popup (or video) disappears as soon as the user releases
                  the pointer (up-event). Since the up-event reverses the preceding down event, the
                  user is returned to their prior point, and has effectively cancelled the operation.
               </p>

            <section id="down-event">
               
               <h3>Down-Event</h3>
               
               <p>Completing the function on the down-event is only permitted when it is essential that
                  the up-event not be used.
               </p>
               
               <p>The most prevalent essential down-event activation occurs in keyboard emulation. On
                  a physical keyboard, keys by default activate on the down-event -- a letter appears
                  when the key is pressed. If a software keyboard emulator tried to override this expected
                  behaviour by making letters appear when the key is released, the behaviour would be
                  unexpected and would adversely affect expected interaction.
               </p>
               
               <p>Note that a keyboard has a built-in Backspace or Delete button, which effectively
                  provides an Undo option. Undo is not a requirement of the down-event Essential exception;
                  however, providing an easy way for users to undo any action is a recommended practice
                  (and may be a functional necessity), even where it is not a requirement of this Success
                  Criterion.
               </p>
               			
               <p>Other examples where the timing of an activation is essential and requires the down-event
                  would be:
               </p>
               			
               <ul>
                  				
                  <li>An activity that emulates a physical on-press trigger, such as when playing an on-screen
                     piano keyboard. Activation on the up-event would significantly alter the desired behaviour.
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>A program for shooting skeets where waiting for the "up" event would invalidate the
                     precise timing necessary for the activation.
