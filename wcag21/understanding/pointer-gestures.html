            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be operated using
               simple inputs on a wide range of pointing devices. This is important for users who
               cannot perform complex gestures, such as multi-point or path-based gestures, in a
               precise manner, either because they may lack the accuracy necessary to carry them
               out or because they use a pointing method that lacks the capability or accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>A path-based gesture involves a user interaction where the gesture's success is dependent
               on the path of the user's pointer movement and not just the endpoints. Examples include
               swiping (which relies on the direction of movement) the dragging of a slider thumb,
               or gestures which trace a prescribed path, as in the drawing of a specific shape.
               Such paths may be drawn with a finger or stylus on a touchscreen, on a graphics tablet
               or trackpad, or with a mouse, joystick, or similar pointer device.
            </p>
            <p>A user may find it difficult or impossible to accomplish these if they have impaired
               fine motor control, or if they use a specialized or adapted input device such as a
               head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulation.
            </p>
            <p>Note that free-form drag and drop actions are not considered path-based gestures for
               the purposes of this Success Criterion.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of multi-point gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where
               one finger rests on the screen and a second finger taps, or a two or three finger
               tap or swipe. A user may find it difficult or impossible to accomplish these if they
               type and point with a single finger or stick, in addition to any of the causes listed
               above.
            </p>
            <p>Authors must ensure that their content can be operated without such complex gestures.
               When they implement multi-point or path-based gestures, they must ensure that the
               functionality can also be operated via single-point activation.  Examples of single-point
               activation on a touchscreen or touchpad include taps, double taps, and long presses.
               Examples for a mouse, trackpad, head-pointer, or similar device include single clicks,
               click-and-hold and double clicks.
            </p>
            <p>The success criterion applies to author-created gestures, as opposed to gestures defined
               on the level of operating system or user agent. An example for gestures provided on
               the operating system level would be swiping down to see system notifications, and
               gestures for built-in assistive technologies (AT) to focus or activate content, or
               to call up AT menus. An example of user agent-implemented gestures would be horizontal
               swiping implemented by browsers for navigating within the page history, or vertical
               swiping to scroll page content.
            </p>
            <p>While some operating systems may provide ways to define "macros" to replace complex
               gestures, content authors cannot rely on such a capability because is not pervasive
               on all touch-enabled platforms. Moreover, this may work for standard gestures that
               a user can predefine, but may not work for other author-defined gestures.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not require all functionality to be available through
               pointing devices, but that which is must be available to users who use the pointing
               device but cannot perform complex gestures. While content authors may provide keyboard
               commands or other non-pointer mechanisms that perform actions equivalent to complex
               gestures (see Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard), this is not sufficient to conform
               to this success criterion. That is because some users rely entirely on pointing devices,
               or find simple pointer inputs much easier than alternatives. For example, a user relying
               on a head-pointer would find clicking a control to be much more convenient than activating
               an on-screen keyboard to emulate a keyboard shortcut, and a person who has difficulty
               memorizing a series of keys (or gestures) may find it much easier to simply click
               on a labeled control. Therefore, if one or more pointer-based mechanisms are supported,
               then their benefits should be afforded to users through simple, single-point actions
               alone.
            </p>
            <p>An exception is made for functionality that is inherently and necessarily based on
               complex paths or multi-point gestures. For example, entering one's signature may be
               inherently path-based (although acknowledging something or confirming one's identity
               need not be).
