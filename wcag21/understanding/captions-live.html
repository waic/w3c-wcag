            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing
               to watch 
               <em>real-time</em> presentations. Captions provide the part of the content available via the audio track.
               Captions not only include dialogue, but also identify who is speaking and notate sound
               effects and other significant audio.
               </p>
            <p>This success criterion was intended to apply to broadcast of synchronized media and
               is not intended to require that two-way multimedia calls between two or more individuals
               through web apps must be captioned regardless of the needs of users. Responsibility
               for providing captions would fall to the content providers (the callers) or the “host”
               caller, and not the application.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
