            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have
               low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where
               meaning depends on pronunciation. Often words or characters have different meanings,
               each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually
               be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous
               sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined
               or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read
               aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be
               even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous
               or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining
               the pronunciation is needed.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               	For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same
               but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon)
               and desert (arid region). If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context
               of the sentence, then nothing is required.  If it cannot then some mechanism for determining
               the proper pronunciation would be required. Additionally, in some languages certain
               characters can be pronounced in different ways. In Japanese, for example, there are
               characters like Han characters(Kanji) that have multiple pronunciations. Screen readers
               may speak the characters incorrectly without the information on pronunciation. When
               read incorrectly, the content will not make sense to users.

                     is provided to users in parentheses right after the word. Giving the reading of the
                     words written in Han characters (Kanji) allows both sighted users and screen readers
                     to read/pronounce the words correctly. Note that screen readers will speak the word
                     twice: the Han characters (Kanji) that can be pronounced in a wrong way are read first
                     and then kana is spoken in order to provide the correct reading.
