            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>
               The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content developers provide
               information in the Web page that user agents need to present text and other linguistic
               content correctly. Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render
               text more accurately when the language of the Web page is identified. Screen readers
               can load the correct pronunciation rules. Visual browsers can display characters and
               scripts correctly. Media players can show captions correctly. As a result, users with
               disabilities will be better able to understand the content.
               
               </p>
            <p>The default human language of the Web page is the default text-processing language
               as discussed in 
               <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html#gslang">Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML &amp; HTML Content</a>. When a Web page uses several languages, the default text-processing language is
               the language which is used most. (If several languages are used equally, the first
               language used should be chosen as the default human language.)

                     For multilingual sites targeting Conformance Level A, the Working Group strongly encourages
                     developers to follow Success Criterion 3.1.2 as well even though that is a Level AA
                     Success Criterion.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
