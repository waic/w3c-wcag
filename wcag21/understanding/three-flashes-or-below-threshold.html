            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content
               of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity.
               
            </p>
            <p>Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered
               by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes. People
               are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is
               provided for saturated red flashing. These guidelines are based on guidelines for
               the broadcasting industry as adapted for computer screens, where content is viewed
               from a closer distance (using a larger angle of vision).
               
            </p>
            <p>Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the
               content being rendered. The author has no control of the first two. They can be addressed
               by the design and speed of the display and computer. The intent of this criterion
               is to ensure that flicker that violates the flash thresholds is not caused by the
               content itself. For example, the content could contain a video clip or animated image
               of a series of strobe flashes, or close-ups of rapid-fire explosions.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion replaces a much more restrictive criterion in WCAG 1.0 that
               did not allow any flashing (even of a single pixel) within a broad frequency range
               (3 to 50 Hz). This Success Criterion is based on existing specifications in use in
               the UK and by others for television broadcast and has been adapted for computer display
               viewing. The 1024 x 768 screen is used as the reference screen resolution for the
               evaluation. The 341 x 256 pixel block represents a 10 degree viewport at a typical
               viewing distance. (The 10 degree field is taken from the original specifications and
               represents the central vision portion of the eye, where people are most susceptible
               to photo stimuli.)
               
            </p>
            <p>The combined area of flashes occurring concurrently and contiguously means the total
               area that is actually flashing at the same time. It is calculated by adding up the
               contiguous area that is flashing simultaneously within any 10 degree angle of view.

                     <li>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed
                        for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)

                     <li>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per
                        second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it
                        could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure
                        could occur faster than most users could turn it off.

                     <li>Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If
                        blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.
