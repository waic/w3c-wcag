         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color" style="font-weight: bold;">1.4.1 Use of Color</a> (Level A): Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an
            action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
            
         </p>
         <p class="note">This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception
            are covered in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#adaptable">Guideline 1.3</a> including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access information
               that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color
               has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences
               in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
               deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through
               another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.
               
            </p>
            <p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,
               its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving
               color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older
               users do not see color well. In addition, people using text-only, limited-color or
               monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented
               only in color.
               
            </p>
            <p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red",
               “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples
               of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open
               in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example
               of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that
               a required field had been left blank.

                     associated with each element name the color of the element and indicate the element's
                     position in the diagram. Students who cannot perceive color have the same information
                     about the compound as their classmates. (This technique also satisfies

                     Form elements which are disabled via markup or scripting, are greyed out and made
                     inactive by the user agent. When in the disabled state these elements do not receive
                     focus. Assistive technologies can programmatically determine the state of disabled
                     elements and will provide this information to the user as the elements are encountered
                     on the page. The change in color and loss of focus provides redundant, visual information
                     about the state of the control.
