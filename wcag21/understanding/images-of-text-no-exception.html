            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who require a particular
               visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the text presentation as required.
               This includes people who require the text in a particular font size, foreground and
               background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.
               
            </p>
            <p>This means implementing the text in a manner that allows its presentation to be changed
               or providing a mechanism by which users can select an alternate presentation. Using
               images of text is an example of an implementation that does not allow users to alter
               the presentation of the text within it.
               
            </p>
            <p>In some situations, a particular visual presentation of the text is essential to the
               information being conveyed. This means that information would be lost without that
               particular visual presentation. In this case implementing the text in a manner that
               allows its presentation to be changed is not required. This includes text that demonstrates
               a particular visual aspect of the text, such as a particular font family, or text
               that conveys an identity, such as text within a company logo.
               
            </p>
            <p>Text that is decorative does not require implementing the text in a manner that allows
               its presentation to be changed.
               
            </p>
            <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
               that is part of a picture that contains significant
               other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
               which visually
               convey important information through more than just text.

                     the quote with 1.5x the line space and further indented from the left margin. CSS
                     is used to position the text; set the spacing between lines; as well as display the
                     text's font family, size, color and decoration.

                  <p>A Web site contains the organization's logo in the top left corner of each Web page.
                     The logo contains logotype (text as part, or all, of the logo). The visual presentation
                     of the text is essential to the identity of the logo and is included as a gif image
                     which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text
                     alternative.

                  <p>A Web page contains a representation of an original letter. The depiction of the letter
                     in its original format is essential to information being conveyed about the time period

                     the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text alternative.

                     including functions to style the text and check spelling. Some of the buttons use
                     text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language.
                     For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check
                     the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not
                     allow the text characteristics to be changed. The buttons have text alternatives.
