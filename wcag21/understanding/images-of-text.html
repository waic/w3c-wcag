            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies
               which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable
               people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the
               text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular
               font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.
               </p>
            <p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present
               the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author
               cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented
               on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion
               would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can
               be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential
               to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc.
               Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not
               widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to
               ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.
               </p>
            <p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image
               of text to match their requirements.
               </p>
            <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
               that is part of a picture that contains significant
               other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
               which visually
               convey important information through more than just text.
               </p>
            <p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success
               Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can
               be achieved with the technologies that the author is using. For Success Criterion
               1.4.9, the sufficient techniques would be applied only when the user can customize
               the output.

                  <p>A Web page uses server-side scripting to present text as an an image. The page includes
                     controls that allow the user to adjust the font size and foreground and background
                     colors of the generated image.

                  <p>A Web page contains a quote. The quote itself is presented as italicized text, indented
                     from the left margin. The name of the person to whom the quote is attributed is below
                     the quote with 1.5x the line space and further indented from the left margin. CSS
                     is used to position the text; set the spacing between lines; as well as display the
                     text's font family, size, color and decoration.

                  <p>A Web page contains a menu of navigation links that have both an icon and text to
                     describe their target. CSS is used to display the text's font family, size and foreground
                     and background colors; as well as the spacing between the navigation links.

                  <p>A Web site contains the organization's logo in the top left corner of each Web page.
                     The logo contains logotype (text as part, or all, of the logo). The visual presentation
                     of the text is essential to the identity of the logo and is included as a gif image
                     which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text
                     alternative.

                  <p>A Web page contains information about a particular font family. Substituting the font
                     family with another font would defeat the purpose of the representation. The representation
                     is included as a jpeg image which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed.
                     The image has a text alternative.

                  <p>A Web page contains a representation of an original letter. The depiction of the letter
                     in its original format is essential to information being conveyed about the time period
                     in which it was written. The letter is included as a gif image which does not allow

                     including functions to style the text and check spelling. Some of the buttons use
                     text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language.
                     For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check
                     the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not
                     allow the text characteristics to be changed. The buttons have text alternatives.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
