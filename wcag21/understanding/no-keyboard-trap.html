         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#no-keyboard-trap" style="font-weight: bold;">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a> (Level A): If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a <a href="#dfn-keyboard-interface">keyboard interface</a>, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface,
            and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit
            methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
            
         </p>
         <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
            ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to
            meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that that content does not "trap"
               keyboard focus within subsections of content on a Web page. This is a common problem
               when multiple formats are combined within a page and rendered using plug-ins or embedded
               applications.
               
            </p>
            <p>There may be times when the functionality of the Web page restricts the focus to a
               subsection of the content, as long as the user knows how to leave that state and "untrap"
               the focus.
