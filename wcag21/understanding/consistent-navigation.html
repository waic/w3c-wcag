            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage the use of consistent presentation
               and layout for users who interact with repeated content within 
               a set of Web pages and need to locate specific information or functionality more than
               once.
               Individuals with low vision who use screen magnification to display a small portion
               of the screen at a time often use visual cues and page boundaries to quickly locate
               repeated content.
               Presenting repeated content in the same order is also important for visual users who
               use spatial memory or visual cues within the design to locate repeated content.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>It is important to note that the use of the phrase "same order" in this section is
               not meant to imply that subnavigation menus cannot be used or that blocks of secondary
               navigation or page structure cannot be used. Instead, this Success Criterion is intended
               to assist users who interact with repeated content across Web pages to be able to
               predict the location of the content they are looking for and find it more quickly
               when they encounter it again. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Users may initiate a change in the order by using adaptive user agents or by setting
               preferences so that the information is presented in a way that is most useful to them.
