            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this guideline is to allow text content to be read by users and by assistive
               technology, and to ensure that information necessary for understanding it is available.
               
            </p>
            <p>People with disabilities experience text in many different ways. For some the experience
               is visual; for some it is auditory; for some it is tactile; for still others it is
               both visual and auditory. Some users experience great difficulty in recognizing written
               words yet understand extremely complex and sophisticated documents when the text is
               read aloud, or when key processes and ideas are illustrated visually or interpreted
               as sign language. For some users, it is difficult to infer the meaning of a word or
               phrase from context, especially when the word or phrase is used in an unusual way
               or has been given a specialized meaning; for these users the ability to read and understand
               may depend on the availability of specific definitions or the expanded forms of acronyms
               or abbreviations. User agents, including speech-enabled as well as graphical applications,
               may be unable to present text correctly unless the language and direction of the text
               are identified; while these may be minor problems for most users, they can be enormous
               barriers for users with disabilities. In cases where meaning cannot be determined
               without pronunciation information (for example, certain Japanese Kanji characters),
               pronunciation information must be available as well

            <h2>Advisory Techniques</h2>
            <p>Specific techniques for meeting each Success Criterion for this guideline are listed
               in the understanding sections for each Success Criterion (listed below). If there
               are techniques, however, for addressing this guideline that do not fall under any
               of the success criteria, they are listed here. These techniques are not required or
               sufficient for meeting any success criteria, but can make certain types of Web content
               more accessible to more people.
