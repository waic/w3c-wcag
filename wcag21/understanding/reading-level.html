            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>
               Content should be written as clearly and simply as possible. The intent of this Success
               Criterion is:
               </p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>to ensure that additional content is available to aid the understanding of difficult
                  or complex text;
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>to establish a testable measure indicating when such additional content is required.</li>
               
               </ul>
            <p>This Success Criterion helps people with reading disabilities while also allowing
               authors to publish difficult or complex Web content. Text difficulty is described
               in terms of the level of education required to read the text. Education levels are
               defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO]],
               which was created to allow international comparison among systems of education.
               
               </p>
            <p>Difficult or complex text may be appropriate for most members of the intended audience
               (that is, most of the people for whom the content has been created). But there are
               people with disabilities, including reading disabilities, even among highly educated
               users with specialized knowledge of the subject matter. It may be possible to accommodate
               these users by making the text more readable. If the text cannot be made more readable,
               then supplemental content is needed. Supplemental content is required when text demands
               reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level—that is, more
               than nine years of school. Such text presents severe obstacles to people with reading
               disabilities and is considered difficult even for people without disabilities who
               have completed upper secondary education.
               </p>
            <p>Reading disabilities such as dyslexia make it difficult to recognize written or printed
               words and associate them with the correct sounds. This is called "decoding" the text.
               Decoding must be automatic in order for people to read fluently. The act of decoding
               text word by word consumes much of the mental energy that most people are able to
               use for understanding what they read.
               Text that uses short, common words and short sentences is easier to decode and usually
               requires less advanced reading ability than text that uses long sentences and long
               or unfamiliar words.
               </p>
            <p>The education level required to read text content (also called "readability") is measured
               by analyzing selected passages of text from the Web page. If the Web page includes
               text written for different purposes or different styles are used, the selected passages
               include samples of the types of content in the Web page and the different styles in
               which the content is written. (In many cases, the Web page contains only one kind
               of text content—e.g., technical documentation, a legal notice, marketing material,
               etc.—and all the content uses the same style.) 
               </p>
            <p>Educators can also measure the education level required to read text content. For
               example, qualified teachers can evaluate text according to local education standards
               to determine if it requires reading ability beyond what is expected for students in
               the last year of lower secondary education.
               </p>
            <p>Because people's names, the names of cities or other proper names cannot be changed
               to shorter names with fewer syllables, and because doing so or just referring to everyone
               by pronouns can make sentences harder to understand, the success criterion specifies
               that proper names can be ignored or removed from the text before assessing whether
               it meets the reading ability requirement. Titles refer to the name of documents, books,
               movies, etc. Titles are removed or ignored for the analysis because changing the words
               in titles might make the titles easier to read but would make it impossible to understand
               the item to which the title refers. This would make it harder to read and understand
               the content. (e.g., a book, academic paper, article, etc.). Therefore, titles are
               also exempted specifically. 
               </p>
            <p>When a Web page contains multiple languages, a readability result should be calculated
               for each language that constitutes at least 5% of the content and that is used in
               full sentences or paragraphs (not just individual words or phrases). The overall readability
               of the page should be judged on the language that yields the worst readability results.
               
               </p>
            <p>The readability of content may also be determined by applying a readability formula
               to the selected passage. Many (though not all) readability formulas base their calculations
               on passages of 100 words. Such formulas have been developed for many languages.  The
               number of words in the passage is counted and the length of the words is determined
               by counting either the number of syllables or the number of characters. Most readability
               formulas also count the number and length of sentences. The average length of words
               and sentences in the content is then used to calculate a readability score.  (Some
               languages, such as Japanese, may include multiple scripts within the same passage.
               Readability formulas for these languages may use the number and length of such "runs"
               in their calculations.)  The result may be presented as a number (for example, on
               a scale from 0-100) or as a grade level.   These results can then be interpreted using
               the education levels described in the International Standard Classification of Education.
               Readability formulas are available for at least some languages when running the spell
               checkers in popular software if you specify in the options of this engine that you
               want to have the statistics when it has finished checking your documents.

                  <p>According to the Open Society Mental Health Initiative, the concept of Easy to Read
                     cannot be universal, and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit the
                     abilities of all people with literacy and comprehension problems. Using the clearest
                     and simplest language appropriate is highly desirable, but the WCAG Working Group
                     could not find a way to test whether this had been achieved. The use of reading level
                     is a way to introduce testability into a Success Criterion that encourages clear writing.
                     Supplementary content can be a powerful technique for people with some classes of
                     cognitive disability.

                        language version of the page may be easier to understand than a written language version
                        since sign language may be their first language. 
                        Some sites may decide to do both or other combinations. No technique will help all
                        users who have difficulty. So different techniques are provided as sufficient techniques
                        here for authors trying to make their sites more accessible. Any numbered technique
                        or combination above can be used by a particular site and it is considered sufficient
                        by the Working Group.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
