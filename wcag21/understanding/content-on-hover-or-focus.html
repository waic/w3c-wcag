            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>Additional content that appears and disappears in coordination with keyboard focus
               or pointer hover often leads to accessibility issues. Reasons for such issues include:
            </p>
            <ol>
               			
               <li>the user may not have intended to trigger the interaction</li>
               			
               <li>the user may not know new content has appeared</li>
               			
               <li>the new content may intefere with a user's ability to do a task</li>
               		
            </ol>
            <p>Examples of such interactions can include custom tooltips, sub-menus and other nonmodal
               popups which display on hover and focus. The intent of this success criterion is to
               ensure that authors who cause additional content to appear and disappear in this manner
               must design the interaction in such a way that users can:
            </p>
            <ul>
               					
               <li>perceive the additional content AND</li>
               					
               <li>dismiss it without disrupting their page experience.</li>
               				
            </ul>
            <p>There are usually more predictable and accessible means of adding content to the page,
               which authors are recommended to employ. If an author <em>does</em> choose to make additional content appear and disappear in coordination with hover
               and keyboard focus, this success criterion specifies three conditions that must be
               met:
            </p>
            <ul>
               					
               <li>dismissable</li>
               					
               <li>hoverable</li>
               					
               <li>persistent</li>
               				
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these is discussed in a separate section.</p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>This SC covers content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself.
                  Therefore, a non-visible component, like a Skip to Main link, that is made visible
                  on keyboard focus (with no <em>additional</em> content beyond the trigger becoming visible) is not covered by the SC.
                  			
               </p>
            </div>
            <section id="dismissable">
               			
               <h3>Dismissable</h3>
               			
               <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that the additional content does not interfere
                  with viewing or operating the page's original content. When magnified, the portion
                  of the page visible in the viewport can be signficantly reduced. Mouse users frequently
                  move the pointer to pan the magnified viewport and display another portion of the
                  screen. However, almost the entire portion of the page visible in this restricted
                  viewport may trigger the additional content, making it difficult for a user to pan
                  without re-triggering the content. A keyboard means of dismissing the additional content
                  provides a workaround.
               </p>
               			
               <p>Alternatively, low vision users who can only navigate via the keyboard do not want
                  the small area of their magnified viewport cluttered with trivial hover text. They
                  need a keyboard method of dismissing something that is obscuring the current focal
                  area.
               </p>
               		
               <p>Two methods may be used to satisfy this condition and prevent such interference:</p>
               			
               <ol>
                  			
                  <li>Position the additional content so that it does not obscure any other content including
                     the trigger, with the exception of white space and purely decorative content, such
                     as a background graphic which provides no information.
                  </li>
                  			
                  <li>Provide a mechanism to easily dismiss the additional content, such as by pressing
                     Escape or selecting a close button.
                  </li>
                  			
               </ol>
               			
               <p>For most triggers of relatively small size, it is desirable for both methods to be
                  implemented.  If the trigger is large, noticing the additional content may be of concern
                  if it appears away from the trigger.  In those cases, only the second method may be
                  appropriate.
               </p>
               			
            </section>
            <section id="hoverable">
               			
               <h3>Hoverable</h3>
               			
               <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that additional content which may appear
                  on hover of a target may also be hovered itself.  Content which appears on hover can
                  be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer
                  over the trigger. When the added content is large, magnified views may mean that the
                  user needs to scroll or pan to completely view it, which is impossible unless the
                  user is able to move their pointer off the trigger without the additional content
                  disappearing.
               </p>
               			
               <p>Another common situation is when large pointers have been selected via platform settings
                  or assistive technology. Here, the pointer can obscure a significant area of the additional
                  content. A technique to view the content fully in both situations is to move the mouse
                  pointer directly from the trigger onto the new content.  This capability also offers
                  significant advantages for users who utilize screen reader feedback on mouse interactions.
                  This condition generally implies that the additional content overlaps or is positioned
                  adjacent to the target.

               <h3>Persistent</h3>
               			
               <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure users have adequate time to perceive the
                  additional content after it becomes visible.  Users with disabilities may require
                  more time for many reasons, such as to change magnification, move the pointer, or
                  simply to bring the new content into their visual field.  Once it appears, the content
                  should remain visible until:
               </p>
               			
               <ul>
                  			
                  <li>The user removes hover or focus from the trigger and the additional content, consistent
                     with the typical user experience;
                  </li>
                  			
                  <li>The user dismisses the additional content via the mechanism provided to satisfy the
                     Dismissable condition; or
                  </li>
                  			
                  <li>The information conveyed by the additional content becomes invalid, such as a 'busy'
                     message that is no longer valid.
                  </li>
                  			
               </ul>

               <ul>
                  			
                  <li>This criterion does not attempt to solve such issues when the appearance of the additional
                     content is completely controlled by the user agent. A prominent example is the common
                     behavior of browsers to display the <code>title</code>  attribute in HTML as a small tooltip.
                  </li>
                  			
                  <li>Modal dialogs are out of scope for this criterion because they must take keyboard
                     focus  and thus should not appear on hover or focus.  Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#on-focus">Success Criterion 3.2.1, On Focus</a>.
                  </li>
                  			
                  <li>Content which can be triggered via pointer hover should also be able to be triggered
                     by keyboard focus.  Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard">Success Criterion 2.1.1, Keyboard</a>.
