            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error
               has occurred and can determine what is wrong. The error message should be as specific
               as possible. 
               						In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, re-displaying the form and indicating
               the fields in error is insufficient for some users to perceive that an error has occurred.
               Screen reader users, for example, will not know there was an error until they encounter
               one of the indicators. They may abandon the form altogether before encountering the
               error indicator, thinking that the page simply is not functional. Per the definition
               in WCAG 2.0, an "input error" is information provided by the user
               that is not accepted. This includes: 
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user, or</li>
               
               
               <li>information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data
                  format or allowed values.
                  
               </li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>the user fails to enter the proper abbreviation in to state, province, region, etc.
                  field; 
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>the user enters a state abbreviation that is not a valid state; </li>
               
               
               <li>the user enters a non existent zip or postal code;</li>
               
               
               <li>the user enters a birth date 2 years in the future;</li>
               
               
               <li>the user enters alphabetic characters or parentheses into their phone number field
                  that only accepts numbers;
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>the user enters a bid that is below the previous bid or the minimum bid increment.</li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <div class="note">

               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page automatically
                     changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error would still
                     need to be described to them as required by the success criterion. Such an error description
                     telling the person of the changed value would meet both this success criterion (Error
                     Identification) and 
                     <a href="error-suggestion" class="understanding">Success Criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion)</a>.

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>The identification and description of an error can be combined with programmatic information
               that user agents or assistive technologies can use to identify an error and provide
               error information to the user. For example, certain technologies can specify that
               the user's input must not fall outside a specific range, or that a form field is required.
               Currently, few technologies support this kind of programmatic information, but the
               Success Criterion does not require, nor prevent it.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>It is perfectly acceptable to indicate the error in other ways such as image, color
               etc, in addition to the text description.

                     phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. If any of the fields of the form
                     are either not completed or completed incorrectly, an alert is displayed notifying
                     the user which field or fields were missing or incorrect.
