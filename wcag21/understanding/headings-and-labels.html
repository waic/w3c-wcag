            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand what information
               is contained in Web pages and how that information is organized. When headings are
               clear and descriptive, users can find the information they seek more easily, and they
               can understand the relationships between different parts of the content more easily.
               Descriptive labels help users identify specific components within the content.
               </p>
            <p>Labels and headings do not need to be lengthy. A word, or even a single character,
               may suffice if it provides an appropriate cue to finding and navigating content.
               </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not require headings or labels. This Success Criterion
               requires that if headings or labels are provided, they be descriptive. This Success
               Criterion also
               does not require that content acting as a heading or label be correctly marked up
               or
               identified - this aspect is covered separately by
               <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>. It is possible for content
               to pass this Success Criterion (providing descriptive content that acts as headings
               or labels) while failing
               Success Criterion 1.3.1 (if the headings or labels aren't correctly marked up/identified).
               Conversely,
               it is also possible for content to pass Success Criterion 1.3.1 (with headings or
               labels correctly
               marked up or identified), while failing this Success Criterion (if those headings
               or labels are not
               sufficiently clear or descriptive).
               </p>
            <p>Further, in the case of labels, this Success Criterion does not take into consideration
               whether or not
               alternative methods of providing an accessible name for form controls and inputs has
               been
               used - this aspect is covered separately by <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2: Name, Role and Value</a>. It is possible
               for controls and inputs to have an appropriate accessible name (e.g. using <code>aria-label="..."</code>)
               and therefore pass Success Criterion 4.1.2, but to still fail this Success Criterion
               (if the label is not
               sufficiently clear or descriptive).
               </p>
            <p>This success criterion does not require the use of labels; however, it does require
               that if labels are present, they must be sufficiently clear or descriptive. Please
               see <a href="labels-or-instructions">3.3.2: Labels or Instructions</a> for more information on the use of labels.

               <li>Descriptive headings are especially helpful for users who have disabilities that make
                  reading slow and for people with limited short-term memory. These people benefit when

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
