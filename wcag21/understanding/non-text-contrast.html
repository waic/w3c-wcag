            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that active user interface components
               (i.e., controls) and meaningful graphics are distinguishable by people with moderately
               low vision. The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in
               <a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed
               by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand
               the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people
               with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive
               technology.
            </p>
            <section id="user-interface-components">
               				
               <h3>Active User Interface Components</h3>
               
               				
               <p>For active controls such as buttons and form fields: any visual information provided
                  that is necessary for a user to identify that a control is present and how to operate
                  it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual
                  information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or
                  focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that
                  state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>This Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between
                  states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear
                  next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links
                  contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the
                  default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors,
                  and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating
                  a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.
               </p>
               
               				
               <h3>Boundaries</h3>
               				
               				
               <p>This success criteria does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating
                  the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify
                  the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon)
                  within a button is visible and there is no visual indication of the hit area then
                  the Success Criterion is passed. If a button with text also has a colored border,
                  since the border does not provide the only indication there is no contrast requirement
                  beyond the text contrast (<a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate
                  the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion
                  of activities.

               <h3>Adjacent colors</h3>
               				
               <p>For user interface components 'adjacent colors' means the colors adjacent to the component.
                  For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external
                  background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.
               </p>

               <p>If the inner background of the component provides contrast with the adjacent background
                  color, a border can be ignored for the purpose of contrast. For example, an input
                  that has a light background on the inside of the field and a dark background around
                  it, could have a dark <em>or</em> a light colored border. As the difference between backgrounds provides contrast,
                  the border is not important for this success criterion.

                  <figcaption>The contrast of the input background (white) and color adjacent to the control (dark
                     blue) is sufficient. There is also a border (silver) on the component that is not
                     required to contrast with either.

               <p>For visual information required to identify a state, such as the check in a checkbox
                  or the thumb of a slider, that part might be within the component so the adjacent
                  color might be another part of the component.

               <h3>Relationship with Use of Color and Focus Visible</h3>
               
               				
               <p>The <a href="../20/use-of-color.html">Use of Color</a> success criterion addresses changing <strong>only the color</strong> (hue) of an object or text without otherwise altering the object's form. The principle
                  is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text
                  or graphics. For example, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/general/G183">G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual
                     cues on focus for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish
                  links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets
                  the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success
                  Criteria <a href="../20/use-of-color.html">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text
                  is a link.
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the
                  value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for
                  each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the
                  Use of color criteria rather than this one.
               </p>

                  <figcaption>
                     						Two examples which pass this success criteria, using either a solid fill to

                     fill.

                  <figcaption>
                     						Two examples which fail a success criteria, the first fails the Use of color
                     criteria due to relying on yellow and white hues. The second example fails the Non-text
                     contrast criteria due to the yellow to white contrast ratio of 1.2:1.

               <p>Using a change of contrast for focus and other states is a technique to differentiate
                  the states. This is the basis for <a class="general" href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/general/G195">G195: Using an author-supplied, highly visible focus indicator</a>, and more techniques are being added.

               <p>In combination with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-visible">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>, the visual focus indicator for a component <em>must</em> have sufficient contrast against the adjacent background when the component is focused,
                  except where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not
                  modified by the author. If the focus state relies on a change of color (e.g., changing
                  <em>only</em> the background color of a button), then changing from one color to another that has
                  at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the previous state of the control is a method for
                  meeting the Focus visible criteria.

                  <p>User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled
                     control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast requirements in WCAG 2.1. An inactive
                     user interface component is visible but not currently operable. An example would be
                     a submit button at the bottom of a form that is visible but cannot be activated until
                     all the required fields in the form are completed.

                  <p>Inactive components, such as disabled controls in HTML, are not available for user
                     interaction. The decision to exempt inactive controls from the contrast requirements
                     was based on a number of considerations:

                  <ul>
                     						
                     <li><strong>Backward compatibility:</strong>  WCAG 2.0 guidance for 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) specifically exempts <q>text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component</q>. It would be confusing and inconsistent to exempt <strong>text</strong> in inactive components from contrast considerations while requiring sufficient contrast
                        for the graphical container the text resides in.
                     </li>

                        <p><strong>Variations in significance:</strong> Depending on the circumstances, disabled controls may be intentionally designed to
                           be more or less visible depending on how meaningful a control's disabled state is.
                           Two examples can illustrate.
                        </p>
                        							
                        <ol>
                           								
                           <li>A control remains disabled only until the user completes a prerequisite task, at which
                              point it becomes active.

                           <li>A designer uses a standard layout for a number of operations. In one operation a control
                              is not valid and so is disabled, but remains visible simply to maintain a consistent
                              layout.

                        <p>The disabled control in the first example offers a more significant cue, and a designer
                           may intentionally decrease the contrast in the second case to de-emphasize its importance.

                     <li><strong>Conflicting needs and desires.</strong> Although meaningful information is conveyed by a lower-contrast disabled control
                        (to those who can perceive it), not all users desire an increase in the prominence
                        of disabled controls.
                        							
                        <ul>
                           								
                           <li>Low-vision - some users want to ignore the disabled elements, just focusing on the
                              enabled elements. Other low vision users want to see the disabled items clearly.
                           </li>
                           								
                           <li> Cognitive - some people with cognitive differences really want to be able to focus
                              on the active elements (and ignore the non-active elements). If we force stronger
                              contrast on the disabled elements, it will likely be difficult for all sighted people
                              to distinguish what is active (and what is disabled).
                           </li>

                  </ul>
                  					
                  <p>A one-size-fits-all solution has been very difficult to establish. A method of varying
                     the presentation of disabled controls, such as adding an icon for disabled controls,
                     based on user preferences is anticipated as an advancement in the future.

               <p>The term "graphical object" applies to stand-alone icons such as a print icon (with
                  no text), and the important parts of a more complex diagram such as each line in a
                  graph. For simple graphics such as single-color icons the entire image is a graphical
                  object. Images made up of multiple lines, colors and shapes will be made of multiple
                  graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.

               <p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings - only those that

                     or part of a graphic (a graphical object) in order to understand the content it should
                     have sufficient contrast. However, that is not a requirement when:

                  <p>Gradients can reduce the apparent contrast between areas, and make it more difficult
                     to test. The general principles is to identify the graphical object(s) required for
                     understanding, and take the central color of that area. If you remove the adjacent
                     color which does not have sufficient contrast, can you still identify and understand
                     the graphical object?

                     method (e.g., focusable elements) can be used to make that information available dynamically
                     as text, or dynamically increase the contrast.

                  <p>Infographics can mean any graphic conveying data, such as a chart or diagram. On the
                     web it is often used to indicate a large graphic with lots of statements, pictures,
                     charts or other ways of conveying data. In the context of graphics contrast, each
                     item within such an infographic should be treated as a set of graphical objects, regardless
                     of whether it is in one file or separate files.

                     because then the infograph is not relied upon for understanding.

                        and therefore exempt. Flags may not be identifiable if the colors are changed to have
                        sufficient contrast.

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving graphics that have insufficient
               contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that
               lowers the contrast even further. Providing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef">relative luminance</a> (lightness difference) of 3:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable
               when the person does not see a full range of colors.

                     <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered
                        (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be
                        evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.

                     <p>For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
                        to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
                        background color is specified, then white is assumed.

                     <p>Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered
                        in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
                        color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
                        be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
                        color is specified when a background color is specified.

                        used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
                        around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
                        fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.
