            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious
               consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed.
               For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase
               stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences.
               If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with
               a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on
               the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more
               stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take
               place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise,
               it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored
               in a database that they later need to access, such as their entire travel profile
               in a travel services web site. When referring to modification or deletion of 'user
               controllable' data, the intent is to prevent mass loss of data such as deleting a
               file or record. It is not the intent to require a confirmation for each save command
               or the simple creation or editing of documents, records or other data.
               
            </p>
            <p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes. People with reading disabilities
               may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys
               by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake
               that could result in serious consequences. Providing the ability to review and correct
               information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action
               that has serious consequences.
               
            </p>
            <p>User-controllable data is user-viewable data that the user can change and/or delete
               through an intentional action. Examples of the user controlling such data would be
               updating the phone number and address for the user's account, or deleting a record
               of past invoices from a website. It does not refer such things as internet logs and
               search engine monitoring data that the user can't view or interact with directly.

                     correctness. The user can either confirm the order or make changes.

                  <p>A financial services Web site lets users buy and sell stock online. When a user submits
                     an order to buy or sell stock, the system checks to see whether or not the market
                     is open. If it is after hours, the user is alerted that the transaction will be an
                     after-hours transaction, is told about the risks of trading outside of regular market
                     hours, and given the opportunity to cancel or confirm the order.
