            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that people can use and switch between
               different modes of input when interacting with web content. Users may employ a variety
               of input mechanisms when interacting with web content. These may be a combination
               of mechanisms such as a keyboard or keyboard-like interfaces and pointer devices like
               a mouse, stylus or touchscreen.
            </p>
            <p>Even though a device may have a primary input mechanism, the user may choose to employ
               alternative input mechanisms when interacting with the device. For example, the primary
               mechanism for mobile phones and tablets is the touchscreen.  The user of these devices
               may choose to use a paired mouse or external keyboard as an alternative to using the
               touchscreen.
            </p>
            <p>Users should be able to switch input mechanisms at any point should the user determine
               that certain tasks and interactions are more easily accomplished by using an alternative
               input mechanism. Content must not limit the user's interaction to any particular input
               mechanism unless the restriction is essential, or is required to ensure the security
               of the content or to respect user settings.
            </p>
            <p>Note: A touch-typing web application, which teaches users how to touch-type on a keyboard
               and/or measures their proficiency and speed, would be an example of an essential limitation
               to a particular input mechanism.

               <li>Users can interact with web content with whichever input mechanism is preferred and
                  available to them.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A user with mobility impairment pairs a mouse and keyboard to her mobile phone with
                  a touchscreen. The phone can thereafter be operated by those input devices and the
                  content does not accept the touchscreen as the only input mechanism.
               </li>
               
               <li>On a touch-enabled laptop with coarse precision, people who have difficulty activating
                  a small target because of hand tremors, limited dexterity or other reasons are still
                  able to interact with content using their keyboard and trackpad.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user starts interacting with a page using a desktop keyboard, and then attaches
                  a secondary touch-enabled monitor. Content can be operated using this newly added
                  input mechanism and does not assume that the keyboard, the first input mechanism it
                  detected, is the only one in use.
               </li>
               
               <li>A speech input user navigates content using voice commands which translate to simulate
                  mouse (and keyboard) commands. When talking with a colleague, however, the user turns
                  speech recognition off and uses the mouse instead.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user opens a menu with a mouse, and then navigates between the menu items with arrow
                  keys.
               </li>
