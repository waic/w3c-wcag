            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to help ensure that people with disabilities
               who rely on visual labels can also use
               			those labels programmatically. Controls are often labeled with visible text. Controls
               also have a programmatic label, known
               			as its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">Accessible Name</a>. Users have a much better experience if the visible text labels of controls match
               their accessible names.
            </p>
            <p>Speech input users can navigate by speaking the visible text labels of menus, links
               and buttons that appear on the
               			screen. It's confusing to speech input users when they say a visible text label
               they see, but the speech input does not work
               			because the accessible name that is enabled as a speech input command does not
               match the visible label.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, when the accessible names of controls are visually hidden, speech users
               may accidentally activate these controls when they happen to speak words that map
               to these hidden accessible names.
            </p>
            <p>Text-to-speech users will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches
               the text they see on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes authors want to add additional text to provide more context to a link or
               other control to make it more descriptive for users of assistive technologies. In
               this case, it is a recommended practice to add that text <strong>after</strong> the visible label so the accessible name starts with the visible label. In the case
               of the search button, the accessible name could be "search this site", in the case
               of the home link, the text could be "home - go to start page". In both cases, the
               hidden portion of the label may be supplied by different means, for example, as text
               accessibly hidden via CSS or by using the aria-label or the aria-labelledby attribute.
            </p>
            <p>This issue is even more important for speech input and text-to-speech users who also
               have cognitive challenges. It’s an extra
               			cognitive load for a speech input user to remember and say a speech command that
               is different from the visible label they see on a
               			control. It’s also an extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb
               and understand speech output that does not
               			match the visible label.
