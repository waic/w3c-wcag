            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure consistent identification of functional
               components that appear repeatedly within a set of Web pages. A strategy that people
               who use screen readers use when operating a Web site is to rely heavily on their familiarity
               with functions that may appear on different Web pages. If identical functions have
               different labels on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more difficult
               to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive
               limitations. Therefore, consistent labeling will help. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>This consistency extends to the text alternatives. If icons or other non-text items
               have the same functionality, then their text alternatives should be consistent as
               well.
               
            </p>
            <p>If there are two components on a web page that both have the same functionality as
               a component on another page in a set of web pages, then all 3 must be consistent.
               Hence the two on the same page will be consistent.
               
            </p>
            <p>While it is desirable and best practice always to be consistent within a single web
               page, 3.2.4 only addresses consistency within a set of web pages where something is
               repeated on more than one page in the set.

               <li>People who learn functionality on one page on a site can find the desired functions
                  on other pages if they are present.

               <li>When non-text content is used in a consistent way to identify components with the
                  same functionality, people with difficulty reading text or detecting text alternatives
                  can interact with the Web without depending on text alternatives.

                  can also search for the component if it has a consistent label on different pages.

                  <p>A document icon is used to indicate document download throughout a site. The text
                     alternative for the icon always begins with the word â€œDownload," followed by a shortened
                     form of the document title. Using different text alternatives to identify document
                     names for different documents is a consistent use of text alternatives.

                  <p>A check mark icon functions as "approved", on one page but as "included" on another.
                     Since they serve different functions, they have different text alternatives.

                  <p> A Web site publishes articles on-line. Each article spans multiple Web pages and
                     each page contains a link to the first page, the next page and the previous page of
                     the article. If the references to the next page read "page 2", "page 3", "page 4"
                     etcetera, the labels are not the same but they are consistent. Therefore, these references
                     are not failures of this Success Criterion.

                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>An e-commerce application uses a printer icon that allows the user to print receipts
                     and invoices. In one part of the application, the printer icon is labeled "Print receipt"
                     and is used to print receipts, while in another part it is labeled "Print invoice"
                     and is used to print invoices. The labeling is consistent ("Print x"), but the labels
                     are different to reflect the different functions of the icons. Therefore, this example
                     does not fail the Success Criterion.

                  <p>A common "save" icon is used through out the site where page save function is provided
                     on multiple Web pages.

                     <strong>Example 6: Icon and adjacent link to same destination</strong>
                     							     
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>An icon with alt text and a link are next to each other and go to the same location.
                     The best practice would be to group them into one link as per 
                     <a class="html" href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/html/H2">H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource</a>. However if they are visually positioned one above the other but separated in the
                     source, this may not be possible. To meet the Success Criterion, the link text for
                     these two links need only be consistent, not identical. But best practice is to have
                     identical text so that when users encounter the second one, it is clear that it goes
                     to the same place as the first.

                     <p>Text alternatives that are "consistent" are not always "identical." For instance,
                        you may have an graphical arrow at the bottom of a Web page that links to the next
                        Web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4." Naturally, it would not be
                        appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next Web page. It would be
                        more appropriate to say "Go to page 5". Although these text alternatives would not
                        be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this Success Criterion.

                        signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the Web page.
                        A check mark icon may function as "approved", "completed", or "included", to name
                        a few, depending on the situation. Using "check mark" as text alternative across all
                        Web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text
                        alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.
