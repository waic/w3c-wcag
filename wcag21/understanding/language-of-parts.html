      <main>
         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present
               content written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and
               assistive technologies to present content according to the  presentation and pronunciation
               rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers,
               braille displays, and other voice browsers.
               </p>
            <p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately
               if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the
               pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters
               and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between
               languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left,
               or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with
               disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to
               understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. 
               </p>
            <p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human
               language is the default human language of the Web page (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a>). So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically
               determined. 
               </p>
            <p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For
               example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in
               English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence
               a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that
               its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently,
               when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word
               has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common
               in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding
               text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt
               whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced
               the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding
               text.
               </p>
            <p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from
               a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal
               nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.
               </p>
            <p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz,
               and habeas corpus.
               </p>
            <p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:</p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute
                  control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent
                  erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text
                  in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the
                  synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the  default language it works
                  in. Thus, the French word for car, "<span lang="fr">voiture</span>" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech
                  synthesizer that uses English as its default language. 
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example
                  users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use
                  machines to translate unfamiliar languages.  
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using
                  a dictionary. 
                  </li>

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
