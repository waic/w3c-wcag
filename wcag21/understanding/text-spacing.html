            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to ensure that people can override text
               spacing to improve their reading experience. Each of the requirements stipulated in
               the SC's four bullets helps ensure text styling can be adapted by the user to suit
               their needs.
            </p>
            <p>This SC focuses on the ability to increase spacing between lines, words, letters,
               and paragraphs. Any combination of these may assist a user with effectively reading
               text. As well, ensuring users can override author settings for spacing also signficantly
               increases the likelihood other style preferences can be set by the user. For example,
               a user may need to change to a wider font family than the author has set in order
               to effectively read text. 
            </p>
            <section id="author-responsibility-">
               
               <h3>Author Responsibility </h3>
               
               <p>This SC does not dictate that authors must set all their content to the specified
                  metrics. Rather, it specifies that an author's content has the ability to be set to
                  those metrics without loss of content or functionality. The author requirement is
                  both to not interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings, and to
                  ensure that content thus modified does not break content in the manners shown in figures
                  1 through 4 in Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override.
               </p>
               
               <section id="applicability">
                  
                  <h4>Applicability</h4>
                  
                  <p>If the markup-based technologies being used are capable of overriding text to the
                     Success Criterion's metrics, then this SC is applicable. For instance Cascading Style
                     Sheet/HTML technologies are quite able to allow for the specified spacing metrics.
                     Plugin technologies would need to have a built-in ability to modify styles to the
                     specified metrics. Currently, this SC does not apply to PDF as it is not implemented
                     using markup.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Examples of text that are typically not affected by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-style-properties">style properties</a> and not expected to adapt are:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Video captions embedded directly into the video frames and not provided as an associated
                        caption file
                     </li>

                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>For this SC, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element">canvas</a> implementations of text are considered to be <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#dfn-image-of-text" target="terms">images of text</a>.

               <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
               
               <p>The ability to read and derive meaning from the overridden spacing rests with the
                  user. If the increased spacing impacts those abilities, the user will adjust or they
                  will return to the default view. Regardless, the user needs the flexibility to adjust
                  spacing within the bounds set in the SC. Such changes may be acheived via user stylesheet,
                  bookmarklet, extension, or application.

                     heading should read "A cog in the wheel." But it reads "A cog in the whe". Only half
                     of the second "e" is visible and the letter "l" is completely missing. The  2nd heading
                     should read "A penny for your thoughts". But it reads "A penny for your". The 3rd

                  speed of actual materials up to .25, but it  started to flatten at .20. Previous studies
                  that reported no improvement started at .5em. Right at the flat point.  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-low-vision-a11y-tf/2017Jun/0047.html">Wayne E.

                  <dl>

                     <dd>Words were spaced farther apart. In languages that do not have words (e.g. Japanese)
                        applying word spacing had no effect. This is expected.
