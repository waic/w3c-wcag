         <p xmlns:wcag="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">All WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for objectively determining
            if content satisfies them. Testing the Success Criteria would involve a combination
            of automated testing and human evaluation. The content should be tested by those who
            understand how people with different types of disabilities use the Web.
            </p>
         
         
         <p xmlns:wcag="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Testing and testable in the context refer to functional testing, that is verifying
            that the content functions as expected, or in this case, that it satisfies the Success
            Criteria. Although content may satisfy all Success Criteria, the content may not always
            be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. Therefore, usability testing
            is recommended, in addition to the required functional testing. Usability testing
            aims to determine how well people can use the content for its intended purpose. It
            is recommended that users with disabilities be included in test groups when performing
            usability testing.

            <h2>What does conformance mean?</h2>
            
            
            <p>Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the 'requirements' of the
               standard. In WCAG 2.0 the 'requirements' are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG
               2.0, you need to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is, there is no content which
               violates the Success Criteria. 
               </p>
            
            
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>This means that if there is no content to which a success criterion applies, the success
                     criterion is satisfied.
                     </p>
                  
                  </div>
            </div>
            
            
            <p>Most standards only have one level of conformance. In order to accommodate different
               situations that may require or allow greater levels of accessibility than others,
               WCAG 2.0 has three levels of conformance, and therefore, three levels of Success Criteria.

            <h2>Understanding Conformance Requirements</h2>
            
            
            <p>There are five requirements that must be met in order for content to be classified
               as 'conforming' to WCAG 2.0. This section provides brief notes on those requirements.
               This section will be expanded over time to address questions that may arise or to
               provide new examples of ways to meet the different conformance requirements.

                        to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels

                        entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria

               <p>The first requirement deals with the levels of conformance. It basically says that
                  all information on a page conforms or has a 
                  <a href="#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate version</a> that is available from the page. The requirement also explains that no conformance
                  is possible without at least satisfying all of the Level A Success Criteria. 
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>The note points out that authors are encouraged to go beyond conformance to a particular
                  level and to complete, and report if they desire, any progress toward higher levels
                  of conformance.

                        in order for the entire page to conform.</p>
                  </div>

               <p>This provision simply requires that the whole page conform. Statements about "part
                  of a page conforming" cannot be made.
                  
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>Sometimes, supplemental information may be available from another page for information
                  on a page. The longdesc attribute in HTML is an example. With longdesc, a long description
                  of a graphic might be on a separate page that the user can jump
                  to from the page with the graphic. This makes it clear that such content is considered
                  part of the Web page, so that requirement #2 is satisfied for the combined set of
                  Web pages considered as a single Web page. Alternatives can also be provided on the
                  same page. For example creating an equivalent to a user interface control.

               <p>There are four provisions that particularly deal with issues of interference with
                  use of the page. These four are included in a note here. A note on each of the provisions
                  indicates that these Success Criteria need to be met for all content including content

                  <p>A Web page incorporates a new interactive graphic technology called "ZAP". Although
                     ZAP is not accessibility-supported, the information that is presented in ZAP is also
                     presented
                     on the page in HTML, so ZAP is not relied upon. So, this page would pass conformance
                     requirement #1.  However, if the user tries to tab through the ZAP content, the focus
                     drops into the ZAP object and gets stuck there.  Once inside, there is nothing the
                     user can do to get the focus back out.  So keyboard users cannot use the bottom half
                     of the page. The ZAP content also is continually flashing brightly at different rates
                     and doesn't stop.   So, people with attention deficit are distracted and those with
                     photosensitive seizure disorders may have seizures.  Conformance requirement #5 prevents
                     situations like these from being possible on a conforming page.

            <h2>Understanding Conformance Claims</h2>
            
            
            <p>It is not required to make any conformance claim in order to conform. If one does
               make a claim, however, all the information required in a conformance claim must be
               provided. There are a number of ways this information can be provided. 
               </p>
            
            <p>Schema.org provides one such option for including discovery metadata within a Web
               page. A set of descriptive accessibility properties is available under the CreativeWork
               type which, among other uses, provides the ability to include a summary of the overall
               accessibility of the page (e.g., the WCAG conformance claim), describe the accessible
               features of the content (e.g., availability of alternative text, extended descriptions
               and captions), and alert users to potential hazards (e.g., flashing). This information
               can be embedded in the page using any of RDFa, JSON and microdata. More information
               about these properties and their expected values is also available on the Web Schemas
               wiki.</p>
            
            
            <p>Here is a claim which has been enhanced with schema.org metadata:</p>
            
            
            <pre>
&lt;div typeof="WebPage" vocab="http://schema.org/"&gt;
    &lt;p property="accessibilitySummary"&gt;On 23 March 2009, all content available on
       the server at &lt;a 
         href="http://www.wondercall.example.com"&gt;http://www.wondercall.example.com&lt;/a&gt;
       conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at &lt;a 
         href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/"
         &gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/&lt;/a&gt;.
       Single-A conformance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The technology that this content "&lt;a&gt;relies upon&lt;/a&gt;" is: 
            HTML 4.01.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The technologies that this content "&lt;strong&gt;uses but does not rely 
            upon&lt;/strong&gt;" are: CSS2, and gif.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This content was tested using the following user agents and assistive 
            technologies: Firefox 1.5 on Windows Vista with Screenreader X 4.0, 
            Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP SP 2 with Screenreader X 3.5, IE 6.0 on Windows 
            2000 SP4 with Screenreader Y 5.0, IE 6.0 on Windows 2000 SP4 with
            Screenreader Z 2.0, and Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP SP2 with Screenreader
            X 4.0, Safari 2.0 with OS X 10.4.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page includes both &lt;span property="accessMode" content="textual"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;
       and &lt;span property="accessMode" content="visual"&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;.
       &lt;span property="accessibilityFeature" content="alternativeText"&gt;Alternative 
       text&lt;/span&gt; is included for all image content and &lt;span 
         property="accessibilityFeature" content="longDescription"&gt;long 
         descriptions&lt;/span&gt; are also provided for images that require more 
       than simple alternate text. All content is available in text, which 
       can be accessed by assistive technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
     </pre>
            
            
            <p>Sometimes, one may want to make a claim for just the content that was added after
               a certain date. Or, one may want to claim WCAG 1.0 conformance for content up to a
               date and WCAG 2.0 for content that was created or modified after that date. There
               are no prohibitions in WCAG 2.0 to any of these practices as long as it is clear which
               pages are claiming conformance to which version of WCAG.

                     technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), not user agents (browsers, assistive technologies,
                     etc.).

               <h3>Partial conformance claims due to third party content</h3>
               
               
               <p>When an author makes a decision to use a third party implementation, they should choose
                  products that meet WCAG requirements. If all content on a page, including third party
                  content, meets all WCAG success criteria then the page conforms to WCAG. However,
                  if the page does not conform to WCAG only for reasons that are legitimately outside
                  the author's control then the author can make a claim of partial conformance. It is
                  important to recognize that this is a statement of non-conformance and there are users
                  who may not be able to access some of the content this page.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>One reason that content may be outside the author's control is because it is being
                  provided by a third party (blogs, portals, news sites). Web pages may also include
                  content via third party libraries, plugins, or widgets.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>Be sure to monitor any content that can change without approval from the web page
                  author, as a page which once conformed may suddenly fail to conform. If it is not
                  possible to monitor and repair the third party content, it is necessary to identify
                  the non-conforming parts of the page for users. If the rest of the web page conforms
                  to WCAG, such a page qualifies for a statement of partial conformance, third party
                  content.

               <p>One of the optional components of a conformance claim is "Information about any additional
                  steps taken that go beyond the Success Criteria to enhance accessibility." This can
                  include additional Success Criteria that have been met, advisory techniques that were
                  implemented, information about any additional protocols used to aid access for people
                  with particular disabilities or needs, etc. Any information that would be useful to
                  people in understanding the accessibility of the pages may be included.

               <h3>Use of metadata to report conformance claims</h3>
               
               
               <p>The most useful way of attaching conformance claims to content would be to do so in
                  standard machine readable form. When this practice is widespread, search tools or
                  special user agents will be able to make use of this information to find and provide
                  content that is more accessible or so the user agents can adjust to the content. There
                  are a number of metadata based options under development for making claims, and authors
                  and tool developers are encouraged to support them.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>In addition, metadata can be used to report conformance to individual Success Criteria
                  once Level A conformance has been achieved.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>There are also programmatic reporting formats such as 
                  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/earl.php">Evaluation and Report Language (EARL)</a> that are being developed that could provide machine readable formats for detailed
                  conformance information. As the reporting formats are formalized and support for them
                  develops, they will be documented here.

            <h2>Understanding Levels of Conformance</h2>
            
            
            <p>First, there are a number of conditions that must be met for a Success Criterion to
               be included at all. These include:
               </p>
            
            
            <ol>
               
               
               <li>All Success Criteria must be 
                  <strong>important access issues for people with disabilities</strong> that address problems beyond the usability problems that might be faced by all users.
                  In other words, the access issue must cause a proportionately greater problem for
                  people with disabilities than it causes people without disabilities in order to be
                  considered an accessibility issue (and covered under these accessibility guidelines).
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>All Success Criteria must also be testable. This is important since otherwise it would
                  not be possible to determine whether a page met or failed to meet the Success Criteria.
                  The Success Criteria can be tested by a combination of machine and human evaluation
                  as long as it is possible to determine whether a Success Criterion has been satisfied
                  with a high level of confidence.
                  </li>
               
               </ol>
            
            
            <p>The Success Criteria were assigned to one of the three levels of conformance by the
               working group after taking into consideration a wide range of interacting issues.
               Some of the common factors evaluated when setting the level included:
               </p>
            
            
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>whether the Success Criterion is 
                  <strong>essential</strong> (in other words, if the Success Criterion isn't met, then even assistive technology
                  can't make content accessible)
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>whether it is possible to satisfy the Success Criterion for 
                  <strong>all Web sites and types of content</strong> that the Success Criteria would apply to (e.g., different topics, types of content,
                  types of Web technology)
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>whether the Success Criterion requires skills that could 
                  <strong>reasonably be achieved by the content creators</strong> (that is, the knowledge and skill to meet the Success Criteria could be acquired
                  in a week's training or less)
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>whether the Success Criterion would impose limits on the "look &amp; feel" and/or function
                  of the Web page. (limits on function, presentation, freedom of expression, design
                  or aesthetic that the Success Criteria might place on authors)
                  </li>
               
               
               <li>whether there are no workarounds if the Success Criterion is not met</li>
               
               </ul>

            <h2>Understanding Accessibility Support</h2>
            
            
            <p>Many of the Success Criteria deal with providing accessibility through assistive technologies
               or special accessibility features in mainstream user agents (for example, a 'show
               captions' option in a media player). That is, the Success Criteria require that something
               be done in the Web content that would make it possible for assistive technologies
               to successfully present the content's information to the user. For example, a picture
               that you were supposed to click on to go to a topic would not be accessible to a person
               who was blind unless text alternatives for the picture were provided in a way that
               user agents including assistive technologies can find and display them. The key here
               is that the text alternative must be included in a way that user agents including
               assistive technologies can understand and use – in a way that is "Accessibility Supported."
               </p>
            
            
            <p>Another example would be a custom control that is included on a Web page. In this
               case, a standard user agent would not ordinarily be able to present an alternative
               to the user. If, however, information about the control including its name, role,
               value, how to set it etc. are provided in a way that assistive technologies can understand
               and control them, then users with assistive technologies will be able to use these
               controls.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>When new technologies are introduced, two things must happen in order for people using
               assistive technologies to be able to access them. First, the technologies must be
               designed in a way that user agents including assistive technologies could access all
               the information they need to present the content to the user. Secondly, the user agents
               and assistive technologies may need to be redesigned or modified to be able to actually
               work with these new technologies.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>"<strong>Accessibility Supported</strong>" means that both of these have been done and that the technology will work with user
               agents and assistive technologies.

               <h3>Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"</h3>
               
               
               <p>This topic raises the question of how many or which assistive technologies must support
                  a Web technology in order for that Web technology to be considered "accessibility
                  supported". The WCAG Working group and the W3C do not specify which or how many assistive
                  technologies must support a Web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility
                  supported. This is a complex topic and one that varies both by environment and by
                  language. There is a need for an external and international dialogue on this topic.
                  Some notes to help in understanding and exploring this topic are:

                        <li>Web technologies may only need to be supported by those specific user agents and assistive
                           technologies deployed at a company. (These may be older versions of user agents and
                           assistive technologies or the very newest versions).
                           </li>
                        
                        
                        <li>Content posted to the public Web may need to work with a broader range of user agents
                           and assistive technologies, including older versions.

                           and even countries. Some environments or countries may provide free assistive technologies.
                           </li>

                           so requiring that a technology be supported by all assistive technologies is not possible.

                     <p>Support for a single older assistive technology is usually not sufficient</p>
                     
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        
                        <li>Support by just one assistive technology (for a given disability) would not usually
                           be enough, especially if most users who need it in order to access content do not
                           have and cannot afford that assistive technology. The exception here would be information
                           distributed to company employees only where they all have one assistive technology
                           (of that type).
                           </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                     
                     </li>
                  
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     
                     <p>Currently assistive technology that is affordable by the general public is often very
                        poor
                        </p>

                        <li>Creating content that can't be used by the general public with disabilities should
                           be avoided. In many cases, the cost of assistive technologies is too high for users
                           who need it. Also, the capabilities of free or low cost AT is often so poor today
                           that Web content cannot be realistically restricted to this lowest (or even middle)
                           common denominator. This creates a very difficult dilemma that needs to be addressed.
                           </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                     
                     </li>
                  
                  </ol>
               
               
               <p>The Working Group, therefore, limited itself to defining what constituted support
                  and defers the judgment of how much, how many, or which AT must support a technology
                  to the community and to entities closer to each situation that set requirements for
                  an organization, purchase, community, etc.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>The Working Group encourages more discussion of this topic in the general forum of
                  society since this lack of generally available yet robust assistive technologies is
                  a problem that affects users, technology developers and authors negatively.

               <h3>Technical Definition of "Accessibility Support"</h3>
               
               
               <p>Basically, a Web content technology is "accessibility supported" when users' assistive
                  technologies will work with the Web technologies 
                  <strong>AND</strong> when the accessibility features of mainstream technologies will work with the technology.
                  Specifically, to qualify as an accessibility-supported technology, the following must
                  be true for a technology:
                  </p>
               
               	
               <blockquote class="scquote"><dt><dfn data-lt="accessibility-supported|accessibility support">accessibility supported</dfn></dt>
<dd>
   
   <p>supported by users' <a>assistive technologies</a> as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other <a>user agents</a></p>
   
   <p>To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a Web content technology (or feature
      of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a Web content technology (or
      feature):
   </p>
   
   <ol>
      
      <li>
         
         <p><strong>The way that the <a>Web content technology</a> is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT). </strong> This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability
            with users' assistive technology in the <a>human language(s)</a> of the content,
         </p>
         
         <p><strong>AND</strong></p>
         
      </li>
      
      <li>
         
         <p><strong>The Web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are
               available to users. </strong> This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:

            <li>
               
               <p>The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also
                  accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);
               </p>
               
               <p><strong>OR</strong></p>

            <li>
               <p>The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility
                  supported;
               </p>
               
               <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate
                  network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization
                  is also accessibility supported;
               </p>
               
               <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are
                  available for download or purchase in a way that:

               <ul>
                  
                  <li>does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability
                     <strong>and</strong></li>

               <h3>Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses</h3>
               
               
               <p>Individual authors will not usually be able to do all of the testing necessary to
                  determine which ways of using which Web technologies are actually supported by which
                  versions of assistive technologies and user agents. Authors may therefore rely on
                  publicly documented compilations that document which assistive technologies support
                  which ways of using which Web technologies. By public, we do not mean that the compilation
                  and its documentation are necessarily generated by a public agency, only that they
                  are available to the public. Anyone can create publicly documented compilations of
                  "Web Technology Uses and their Accessibility Support." People may create compilations
                  and give them names that authors can refer to them by. As long as they are publicly
                  documented, authors or customers etc. can easily select uses that meet their needs.
                  Customers or others can pick technologies that fit their environment or language at
                  any point in time and specify those to be used in creating their content. Authors
                  are strongly encouraged to use sources that have an established reputation for accuracy
                  and usefulness. Technology developers are strongly encouraged to provide information
                  about the accessibility support for their technologies. The Working Group anticipates
                  that only documents that provide accurate information and benefit both authors and
                  users will achieve market recognition in the long term.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>There is no requirement in WCAG that a publicly documented compilation be used or
                  that only technology uses from such a compilation be used. The publicly documented
                  compilations are described only as a method to make an otherwise critical, but somewhat
                  complicated, aspect of conformance easier for authors who are not themselves experts
                  on assistive technology support (or who just don't have the time to keep up with advances
                  in mainstream and assistive technology support for each other).

               <p>Authors, companies or others may wish to create and use their own compilations of
                  accessibility-supported technology uses and this is allowed in meeting WCAG. Customers,
                  companies or others may, however, specify that technology uses from a custom or public
                  compilation be used. See

            <h2>Understanding "Programmatically Determined"</h2>
            
            
            <p>Several Success Criteria require that content (or certain aspects of content) can
               be "programmatically determined." This means that the content is authored in such
               a way that user agents, including assistive technologies, can access the information.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>In order for content created with Web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, PDF, GIF, MPEG,
               etc.) to be accessible to people with different types of disabilities, it is
               essential that the technologies used work with the accessibility features of browsers
               and other user agents, including assistive technologies. In order for something to
               meet a Success Criterion that requires it to be "programmatically determined," it
               would need to be implemented using a technology that has assistive technology support.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>Content that can be "programmatically determined" can be transformed (by user agents
               including AT) into different sensory formats (e.g., visual, auditory) or styles of
               presentation need by individual users. If existing assistive technologies cannot do
               this, then the information cannot be said to be programmatically determined.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>The term was created in order to allow the working group to clearly identify those
               places where information had to be accessible to assistive technologies (and other
               user agents acting as accessibility aids) without specifying exactly how this needed
               to be done. This is important because of the continually changing nature of the technologies.
               The term allows the guidelines to identify what needs to be "programmatically determined"
               in order to meet the guidelines, and then have separate documents (the How to Meet,
               Understanding, and Technique documents), which can be updated over time, list the
               specific techniques that will work and be sufficient at any point in time based on
               user agent and assistive technology support.

               <p>"Accessibility supported" relates to support by user agents (including assistive technologies)
                  of particular ways of using Web technologies. Uses of Web technologies that are accessibility
                  supported will work with assistive technologies and access features in mainstream
                  user agents (browsers and players etc.).
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>"Programmatically determined" relates to the information in Web Content. If technologies
                  that are accessibility supported are used properly, then assistive technologies and
                  user agents can access the information in the content (i.e., programmatically determine
                  the information in the content) and present it to the user.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>The two concepts work together to ensure that information can be presented to the
                  user by user agents including assistive technologies. Authors must rely only on uses
                  of technologies that are accessibility-supported — and must use them properly in order
                  for the information to be programmatically determinable — and hence presentable, by
                  assistive technologies and user agents to users with disabilities.

   <p class="note">The conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance,

               <p>Why does WCAG permit conforming alternate versions of Web pages to be included in
                  conformance claims? That is, why include pages that do not satisfy the Success Criteria
                  for a conformance level in the scope of conformance or a claim?

                  <li>Sometimes, pages use technologies that are not yet accessibility supported. When a
                     new technology emerges, assistive technology support may lag behind, or may only be
                     available to some target audiences. So authors may not be able to rely on the new
                     technology for all users. However, there may be other benefits to using the new technology,
                     e.g., better performance, a wider range of modalities available, etc. The alternate
                     version requirement allows authors to include such Web pages in their Web site by
                     providing an accessible alternative page in technologies that are accessibility supported.
                     Users for whom the new technology is adequately supported get the benefits of the
                     new version. Authors who look ahead to future accessibility support can satisfy the
                     Success Criteria now with the alternate version page, and also work with the other
                     page to build in future access when assistive technology (AT) support is available.

                  <li>Sometimes, the best experience for users with certain types of disabilities is provided
                     by tailoring a Web page specifically to accommodate that disability. In such a situation,
                     it may not be possible or practical to make the Web page accommodate all disabilities
                     by satisfying all of the Success Criteria. The alternate versions requirement permits
                     such specialized pages to be included within a conformance claim as long as there
                     is a fully conformant 'alternate version' page.
                     </li>
                  
                  
                  <li>Many sites which are committed to accessibility have large quantities of legacy documents.
                     While the information has been made available in accessible formats, there would be
                     significant institutional resistance and procedural obstacles to removing these files
                     en mass. Some organizations, especially governmental bodies, give precedence to traditional
                     print-oriented processes. Even as these organizations have adapted to Internet publishing
                     and embraced the need for accessible formats, they still retain a paper mindset and
                     often insist on formats designed for hard copy as the "primary" version (even for
                     documents that are only ever "published" electronically). Although the Working Group
                     feels these approaches should be deprecated it does not feel they can be forbidden
                     so long as accessible versions are readily available.
                     </li>
                  
                  </ul>
               
               
               <p>A concern when permitting Web pages that do not satisfy the Success Criteria is that
                  people with disabilities will encounter these non-conforming pages, not be able to
                  access their content, and not be able to find the “conforming alternate version."
                  A key part of the Alternate Versions provision, therefore, is the ability to find
                  the conforming page (the alternate version) from the non-conforming page when it is
                  encountered. The conformance requirement that permits alternate pages, therefore,
                  also requires a way for users to find the accessible version among the alternate versions.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>Note that providing an alternate version is a fallback option for conformance to WCAG
                  and the preferred method of conformance is to make all content directly accessible.

               <h3>Techniques for Providing a Conforming Alternate Version</h3>
               
               
               <p>The most important part of providing a conforming alternate version is providing a
                  mechanism to find it from the non-conforming version. A number of different methods
                  for doing this have been identified since particular techniques may not always be
                  possible for specific technologies or situations. For example, if the author has control
                  of the server there are some powerful techniques that will allow users to always have
                  the choice up front. In many cases however the author may not have control of the
                  services on their Web server. In these cases other techniques are provided. A link
                  on the non-conforming page is another powerful technique but not all non-conforming
                  technologies support hypertext links.
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>Below are the techniques that have been identified to date. We expect that additional
                  techniques will also be developed over time and they will be added here as they arise
                  and the support for these approaches by user agents including assistive technologies
                  can be demonstrated. For example a developer of a new technology that some assistive
                  technologies cannot access might build in a feature that would allow those technologies
                  to automatically present a link to users that could take them to an alternate version.

            <h2>Understanding "Web Page"</h2>
            
            
            <p>The definition of a Web Page is:</p>
            
            	
            <blockquote class="scquote"><dt><dfn data-lt="web page(s)|web pages">Web page</dfn></dt>
<dd>
   
   <p>a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources
      that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a <a>user agent</a></p>
   
   <p class="note">Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource,
      they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded"
      within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page.
   </p>
   
   <p class="example">A Web resource including all embedded images and media.</p>
   
   <p class="example">A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program
      lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area
      and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar
      to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.
   </p>
   
   <p class="example">A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of
      different content modules.
   </p>
   
   <p class="example">When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like
      interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging
      products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of
      you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet
      floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a
      Web site.
   </p>

            <p>It is important to note that, in this standard, the term "Web page" includes much
               more than static HTML pages. The term 'Web Page' was used in these guidelines to allow
               the guidelines to be more understandable. But the term has grown in meaning with advancing
               technologies to encompass a wide range of technologies, many of which are not at all
               'page-like'. It also includes the increasingly dynamic Web pages that are emerging
               on the Web, including "pages" that can present entire virtual interactive communities.
               For example, the term "Web page" would include an immersive interactive movie-like
               experience that you find at a single URI.

            <h2>Understanding "Text Alternatives"</h2>
            
            
            <p>A text alternative is text that is used in place of non-text content for those who
               cannot view the non-text content. Non-text content includes  such things as pictures,
               charts, applets, audio files, etc. People who cannot see for example would not be
               able to see information presented in a picture or chart. A text alternative is therefore
               provided that allows the user to be able to convert the information (the text) into
               speech. In the future, having the information in text also makes it possible to translate
               the information into sign language, into pictures, or into a simpler form of writing.
               </p>
            
            
            <p> In order for people with disabilities to be able to use this text - the text must
               be "programmatically determinable."  This means that the text must be able to be read
               and used by the assistive technologies (and the accessibility features in browsers)
               that people with disabilities use.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>It must also be possible for people using assistive technologies to find these text
               alternatives when they encounter non-text content that they cannot use. To accomplish
               this, we say that the text must be "programmatically associated" with the non-text
               content.  This means that the user must be able to use their assistive technology
               to find the alternative text (that they can use) when they land on the non-text content
               (that they can't use).

                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
