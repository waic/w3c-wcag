            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each
               link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link. Whenever possible, provide
               link text that identifies the purpose of the link without needing additional context.
               Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are
               on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want
               to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish
               to tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow
               without requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.
               
            </p>
            <p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the
               link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name
               of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of
               the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is
               not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may
               also describe the purpose of the link. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               
               <a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application
               being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
               Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
               continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>In some situations, authors may want to provide part of the description of the link
               in logically related text that provides the context for the link. In this case the
               user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from
               the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without
               losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in
               the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link, or in the table
               header cell for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with
               the link itself. Alternatively, authors may choose to use an ARIA technique to associate
               additional
               text on the page with the link.
               
            </p>
            <p>This context will be most usable if it precedes the link. (For instance, if you must
               use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that describes
               its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the
               sentence.) If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty
               for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).
               
               
            </p>
            <p>It is a best practice for links with the same destination to have consistent text
               (and this is a requirement per 
               <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> for pages in a set). It is also a best practice for links with different purposes
               and destinations to have different link text.
               
            </p>
            <p>A best practice for links to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#" target="terms">conforming alternate versions</a> is to ensure that the link text to the conforming alternate version indicates in
               link text that the page it leads to represents the more accessible version. This information
               may also be provided in text - the goal is to ensure that the end user knows what
               the purpose of the link is. 
            </p>
            <p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
               link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,
               the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
               available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
               on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
               available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy
               the Success Criterion.

                  <p>There may be situations where the purpose of the link is is supposed to be unknown
                     or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door
                     #2, and door #3. This link text would be sufficient because the purpose of the links
                     is to create suspense for all users.
