         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to describe a failure where status messages are
               used in content but are not communicated to the user due to a lack of appropriate
               roles or properties.
            </p>
            <p>The initial step in confirming a failure of Status Messages is to check that new dynamic
               content meets the definition of a status message. There are two criteria that determine
               if changed content on a page represents a status message:
               				
               <ol>
                  					
                  <li>the new content does not take focus (does not change context);</li>
                  					
                  <li>the new content provides information to the user on the outcome of an action, the
                     state of an application, the progress of a process, or the existence of errors.
                  </li>
                  				
               </ol>
               			 Where updated content does not conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-status-messages">definition of status message</a>, a failure of 4.1.3 has not taken place.
            </p>
            <p>The second step in this failure technique involves examining code.  Where dynamic
               content meets the definition of a status message, its container can be examined for
               an appropriate WAI-ARIA role or property which allows it to be programmatically determinable
               as a status message. Currently there are only a small number of techniques available
               to indicate status messages to assistive technologies. They are:
               					
               <ul>
                  						
                  <li><code>role="status"</code></li>
                  						
                  <li><code>role="alert"</code></li>
                  						
                  <li>the use of an <code>aria-live</code> attribute on an element, set to either "polite" or "assertive"
                  </li>
                  						
                  <li><code>role="log"</code></li>
                  						
                  <li><code>role="progressbar"</code></li>
                  						
               </ul>
               				The absence of all of these techniques predicts a failure for the status message
               be announced to the user. Additionally, if the role or property is not set <em>before</em> the dynamic content is added, this also predicts a failure.
            </p>
            <p>Since additional techniques may exist to alert an assistive technology, the final
               step of this failure technique is confirming whether an assistive technology (such
               as a screen reader) detects the dynamic content and exposes the information to users.
               Where a status message exists but is not surfaced by assistive technology, it is confirmation
               that a failure has taken place.

               <h3>Example 1: Including a search results message without a status role</h3>
               <p>When a user carries out a search by pressing a Search button, the page content is
                  updated with the results of the search, displayed in a section below the Search button.
                  Since the search has no results, the change to content conveys the status message
                  "0 results returned". This text is not given an appropriate role for a status message,
                  and so a screen reader will not announce "Zero results returned" unless the user repositions
                  to that text. Since the status message is not automatically presented to the user
                  (i.e., instead, it must be manually discovered by the individual), it fails 4.1.3.
