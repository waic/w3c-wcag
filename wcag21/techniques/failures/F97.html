         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to describe how restricting the view of content
               to a single orientation is a failure to allow content to be viewed in multiple orientations.
               When content is presented with a restriction to a specific orientation, users must
               orient their devices to view the content in the orientation that the author imposed.
               Some users have their devices mounted in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a
               power wheelchair), and if the content cannot be viewed in that orientation it creates
               problems for the user.
            </p>
            <p>If a specific orientation is determined to be <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#" target="terms">essential</a> for the operation and viewing of the content, then this failure technique will not
               apply.

            <ul>
               				
               <li>A news app always shows the content in portrait orientation. Users can view the content
                  on a device which supports landscape and portrait display orientations. When the device
                  is turned to landscape view, the content appears sideways to the user.

                     that restrict or allow orientation changes, check that the controls can be set to
                     allow checks one and two to be true.
