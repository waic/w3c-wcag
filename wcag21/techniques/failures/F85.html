            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This describes the failure condition that results when a Web page opens a dialog or
               menu interface component embedded on the page in a way that makes it difficult for
               a keyboard user to operate because of its position in the sequential navigation order.
               When the user opens the dialog or menu embedded on the page by activating a button
               or link, his next action will be to interact with the dialog or menu. If focus is
               not set to the dialog or menu, and it is not adjacent to the trigger control in the
               sequential navigation order, it will be difficult for the keyboard user to operate
               the dialog or menu.

                  navigation order
               </h3>
               <p>When a DHTML menu or dialog is activated, it is created dynamically, positioned visually
                  near the trigger, and appended to the end of the DOM. Because it is appended to the
                  end of the DOM, it is at the end of the sequential navigation order. The user must
                  tab through the rest of the web page before he can interact with the dialog or menu.

               <p>When a menu is dismissed, it is removed or hidden from the web page and focus is set
                  to the document. The user must tab from the beginning of the navigation sequence to
                  reach the point from which the menu was opened.
