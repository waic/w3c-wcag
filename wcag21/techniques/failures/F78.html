            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This describes a failure condition that occurs when the user agent's default visual
               indication of keyboard focus is turned off or rendered non-visible by other styling
               on the page without providing an author-supplied visual focus indicator. Turning off
               the focus indicator instructs the user agent not to present the focus indicator. Other
               styling may make it difficult to see the focus indicator even though it is present,
               such as outlines that look the same as the focus outline, or thick borders that are
               the same color as the focus indicator so it cannot be seen against them.

               <h3>Example 1: The focus indicator is turned off with CSS</h3>
               <p>The following CSS example will remove the default focus indicator, which fails the
                  requirement to provide a visible focus indicator.
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">:focus {outline: none}</pre></section>
            <section class="example" id="example-2-the-outline-of-elements-is-visually-similar-to-the-focus-indicator">
               <h3>Example 2: The outline of elements is visually similar to the focus indicator</h3>
               <p>The following CSS example will create an outline around links that looks the same
                  as the focus indicator. This makes it impossible for users to determine which one
                  in fact has the focus, even though the user agent does draw the focus indicator.
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">a {outline: thin dotted black}</pre></section>
            <section class="example" id="example-3-elements-have-a-border-that-occludes-the-focus-indicator">
               <h3>Example 3: Elements have a border that occludes the focus indicator</h3>
               <p>The following CSS example creates a border around links that does not have enough
                  contrast for the focus indicator to be seen when drawn on top of it. In this case
                  the focus indicator is drawn just ouside the border, but as both are black and the
                  border is thicker than the focus indicator, it no longer meets the definition of "visible".
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">a {border: medium solid black}</pre></section>
