         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this failure condition is to avoid substituting characters whose
               glyphs look similar to the intended character, for that intended character. The Unicode
               character set defines thousands of characters, covering dozens of writing systems.
               While the glyphs for some of these characters may look like the glyphs for other characters
               in visual presentation, they are not processed the same by text-to-speech tools.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the characters U+0063 and U+03F2 both look like the letter "c", yet the
               first is from the Western alphabet and the second from the Greek alphabet and not
               used in Western languages. The characters U+0033 and U+04E0 both look like the number
               "3", yet the second is actually a letter from the Cyrillic alphabet.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>This failure also applies to the use of character entities. It is the incorrect character
                     used because of its glyph representation that comprises a failure, not the mechanism
                     by which that character is implemented.

                  which is a letter from the Western alphabet. This word will not be processed meaningfully,

                  are implemented with character entities, but the word will still not be processed
