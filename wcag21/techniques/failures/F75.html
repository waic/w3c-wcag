            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which synchronized media alternatives
               provide more information than the text for which they are alternatives, but do not
               provide their own text alternatives to provide access to the extra information. Synchronized
               media alternatives provide enhanced access to users for whom synchronized media is
               a more effective format than text. Since they are alternatives to text, they do not
               need themselves to have redundant text alternatives in the form of captions, audio
               descriptions or full text alternatives. However, if they provide more information
               than the text for which they are an alternative, then they are not just alternatives
               but are synchronized media content in their own right. In this case they are subject
               to the full requirements of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.2</a> to provide captions and to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.3</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-description-prerecorded">1.2.5</a>.
