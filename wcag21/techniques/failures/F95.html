         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this failure is to describe a situation where users find it difficult
               or impossible to move the pointer over additional content that appears on hover. For
               users of screen magnification software, the new content is often not fully visible
               in the current magnifed section. In order to perceive it, it is therefore critical
               for these users to be able to move the pointer away from the trigger and over the
               additional content, and thereby change the position of the magnified section, without
               this content disappearing.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               				
               <li>A pop-up opens on pointer hover. Due to the chosen screen magnification, the content
                  is only partially visible. However, as soon as the pointer is moved away from the
                  trigger towards the pop-up content so it can be read, the pop-up automatically closes.
               </li>
               				
               <li>Hovering over a chart with data points, pop-ups open to show details of the respective
                  data point, somewhat offset from the data point itself. When moving the pointer towards
                  the pop-up so it can be fully read with magnification, the pointer travels over other
                  data points that cause the appearance of other pop-ups that replace the particular
                  pop-up the user wanted to see.
