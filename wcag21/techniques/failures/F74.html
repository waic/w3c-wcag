            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which synchronized media alternatives
               are not labeled with the text for which they are alternatives. Synchronized media
               alternatives provide enhanced access to users for whom synchronized media is a more
               effective format than text. Since they are alternatives to text, they do not need
               themselves to have redundant text alternatives. However, they need to be clearly labeled
               with the text for which they substitute, so users can find them and so users who normally
               expect text alternatives to synchronized media know not to look for them.

               <h3>Example 1: Synchronized media alternatives provided elsewhere on page</h3>
               <p>A page with instructions to complete a tax form provides a prose description of the
                  fields to complete, data to provide, etc. Additionally, a synchronized media alternative
                  provides spoken instructions, with video of a person completing the section being
                  discussed in the audio. Although both versions are provided on the page, the synchronized
                  media version is provided elsewhere on the page and is not clearly labeled with the
                  part of the text for which it is a substitute. This makes it difficult for users encountering
                  the text to find it, and users encountering the video do not know where its text alternative
                  is.
