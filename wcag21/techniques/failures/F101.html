         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this Failure is to describe situations where:</p>
            <ol> 
               					
               <li>Controls are set to activate functionality on the down-event of a pointer;</li>
               					
               <li>No further mechanism to abort or undo is available;</li>
               					
               <li>The up-event does not reverse the outcome of the activation;</li>
               					
               <li>It is not essential for the functionality to execute and complete on the down-event.</li>
               				
            </ol>
            <p>Rather than taking advantage of the <code>click</code> event, authors may use down-events such as <code>mousedown</code>, <code>touchstart</code> or <code>pointerdown</code>. As a result, functionality will be executed as soon as a mouse button is pressed
               (but not released yet), or a finger or stylus makes contact with a touchscreen.
            </p>
            <p>It is possible to use the down event and mitigate potential issues to avoid failing
               the Success Criterion. For example, provide a method to easily undo or abort the functionality,
               or reverse the outcome on the up-event (when the mouse button is released, or when
               the finger or stylus are lifted from the touchscreen). And note that some uses of
               the down-event are essential for the functionality (e.g., where the control simulates
               the operation of a musical instrument like a set of piano keys, or when the control
               is used as an on-screen control for a game where a fast and immediate response is
               required), in which case they would not fail this Success Criterion.
            </p>

               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>The test procedure outlined below could be supplemented with automated or semi-automated
                  tests to scan for JavaScript that registers event listeners such as <code>mousedown</code>, <code>touchstart</code>, or <code>pointerdown</code>. The automated test would not be sufficient to make a pass/fail determination, but
                  it can help narrow down the number of potentially problematic controls.

               <h3>Example 1: A close button that triggers on down-events</h3>
               <p>A modal dialog contains a lengthy form that a user needs to complete. The modal provides
                  a simple "Close" control that closes the dialog and loses all information the user
                  may already have entered in the form. However, instead of simply listening to the
                  <code>click</code> event - which in most user agents is triggered on the up-event - the author decided
                  to close the dialog on the down-event. This may lead to the user accidentally closing
                  the dialog and losing all the data they entered into the form up to that point.

                     <!-- modal dialog with a form -->

const trigger = document.getElementById("close");

  /* close the modal dialog */
