            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which people who cannot perceive
               color differences cannot identify links (when people with color vision can identify
               links). Link underlines or some other non-color visual distinction are required (when
               the links are discernible to those with color vision). 
            </p>
            <p>While some links may be visually evident from page design and context, such as navigational
               links, links within text are often visually understood only from their own display
               attributes. Removing the underline and leaving only the color difference for such
               links would be a failure because there would be no other visual indication (besides
               color) that it is a link.
            </p>

               <div>
                  
                  <p>Red and Pink are the same color (hue) but they have different lightness (which is
                     not color ).   So red and pink would pass the requirement for "not distinguished by
                     color (hue) alone" since they differ by lightness (which is not color) - as long as
                     the difference in lightness (contrast) is 3:1 or greater. For example, if surrounding
                     text is RED and the link is PINK it would pass.  Similarly a light green and a dark
                     red differ BOTH by color AND by lightness so they would pass if the contrast (lightness)
                     difference is 3:1 or greater before focus or pointing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>There is no requirement that links be identifiable by people who cannot perceive color
                     if they are not perceivable for those with color vision. (e.g. if the links are hidden
                     for everyone â€“ as in a game or test).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If the non-color cue only happens when the mouse hovers over the link or when the
                     link receives focus, it is still a failure.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If the link is a different color and bold it would not fail because the boldness is
                     not color dependent.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>A Web page includes a large number of links within the body text. The links are styled
                  so that they do not have underlines and are very similar in color to the body text.
                  This would be a failure because users would be unable to differentiate the links from
                  the body text.
