            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This failure ensures that people with visual or cognitive disabilities will recognize
               phone number fields and understand what information to provide to fill in the fields.
               Phone numbers are frequently formatted in fixed, distinctive ways, and authors may
               feel that just providing visual formatting of the fields will be sufficient to identify
               them. However, even if all the fields have programmatically determined names, a text
               label must also identify the set of fields as a phone number.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>In the United States, phone numbers are broken into a three digit area code, a three
                  digit prefix, and a four digit extension. A web page creates fixed length text input
                  fields for the three parts of the phone number, surrounding the first field with parenthesis
                  and separating the second and third fields with a dash. Because of this formatting,
                  some users recognize the fields as a phone number. However, there is no text label
                  for the phone number on the web page. This is because the label for each field will
                  be the closest preceding text, so the three fields would be labeled "(", ")" , and
                  "-" respectively.
