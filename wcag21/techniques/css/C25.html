            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The intent of this technique is to specify borders and layout using CSS and leave
               text and background colors to render according to the user's browser and/or operating
               system settings (Please see above note in relation to Safari). This allows users to
               view the text in the colors they require while maintaining other aspects of the layout
               and page design such as columns of text, borders around sections or vertical lines
               between a menu and main content area. It will also prevent some display issues in
               some browsers when pages contain Javascript pop-up boxes or drop-down menus and have
               the colors overridden.
            </p>
            <p>Borders and layout indicators help many people with cognitive disabilities, as does
               flexibility over the text and background colors. Sometimes these two needs are in
               conflict when the user has to over-ride the author's color selection of text and background
               in the browser and the browser also removes the borders and the intended layout. This
               can mean the page is displayed in a single column with one block of content below
               the other, which can result in unnecessary whitespace and long lines of text. It can
               also mean that pop-up boxes gain a transparent background, superimposing the text
               of the box on the text of the page, and drop-down menus either become transparent
               or gain a dark-grey background. When a Web author does not specify the colors of any
               text and background, while specifying border colors and layout, it is possible, in
               most popular browsers, to change the text and background colors without affecting
               the other (author-specified) CSS declarations.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>A Web page is designed using HTML. CSS is used to specify border colors around discrete
                  areas of the page and to layout the content so that the menu floats to the left of
                  the main content area. Neither the text color nor background is specified. The user
                  sets their own colors in the browser. They can view the page in colors and contrasts
                  that work well for them without disrupting the layout.
