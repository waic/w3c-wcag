            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an alternative to audio description for
               synchronized media that has no important time based information contained in the video
               portion of the media. This particularly applies to "talking head" videos where a person
               is talking in front of an unchanging background, such as a press conference, company
               president talk, or government announcement, etc. In this case there are no "important
               visual details" which would warrant audio description.
               			
            </p>
            <p>Audio description is not necessary when there is one person speaking against an unchanging
               background because there is no time-based visual information in the video that is
               "important" to the understanding of the content. The environment is static and therefore
               can be described in a non-multimedia static format such as alternative text that is
               programmatically associated with the video.
               			
            </p>
            <p>All that is necessary in this case is a static text alternative which would contain
               a general description of the context of the environment, any opening/closing credits,
               any text that appears in the bottom of the video with the name of the speaker, and
               other basic information, if these are seen on the screen and cannot be heard in the
               audio.
               			
            </p>
            <p>This technique does NOT apply to a situation where there are multiple speakers and
               where the identity of each new speaker is not evident in the audio track but is identified
               on screen with visual text as they speak. In this case, audio description should be
               used, and this  technique would not apply.

               <h3>Example 1: A video of a CEO speaking to shareholders</h3>
               <p>A CEO is speaking to shareholders from his office. The video has a title page at the
                  beginning of the video giving the date. When the speaker begins, there is a strip
                  of text at the bottom of the video saying "John Doe, President of XYZ Cooperation".
                  At the end of the video are title credits that say "produced by the Honest TV Productions
                  Ltd."
                  					
               </p>
               <p>As an alternative, there is a paragraph below the video which is associated with the
                  video file using aria-describedby which says: "July 22, 2011, John Doe, President
                  of XYZ cooperation, speaking from his office. Video produced by the Honest TV Productions
