            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When users enter input that is validated, and errors are detected, the nature of the
               error needs to be described to the user in manner they can access. One approach is
               to present an alert dialog that describes fields with errors when the user attempts
               to submit the form. Another approach, if validation is done by the server, is to return
               the form (with the user's data still in the fields) and a text description at the
               top of the page that indicates the fact that there was a validation problem, describes
               the nature of the problem, and provides ways to locate the field(s) with a problem
               easily. The "in text" portion of the Success Criterion underscores that it is not
               sufficient simply to indicate that a field has an error by putting an asterisk on
               its label or turning the label red. A text description of the problem should be provided.
            </p>
            <p>When input must be one of a set of allowed values, the text description should indicate
               this fact. It should include the list of values if possible, or suggest the allowed
               value that is most similar to the entered value.

            <ul>
               
               <li>The user inputs invalid data on a form field. Before the user submits the form, an
                  alert dialog appears that describes the nature of the error so the user can fix it.
               </li>
               
               <li>The user inputs invalid data on a form field and submits the form. The server returns
                  the form, with the user's data still present, and indicates clearly in text at the
                  top of the page that there were input errors. The text describes the nature of the
                  error(s) and clearly indicates which field had the problem so the user can easily
                  navigate to it to fix the problem.
