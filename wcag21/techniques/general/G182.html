            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may
               not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate
               the different status of words that are part of a paragraph or other block of text
               or where special characters or graphics cannot be used to indicate which words have
               special status. For example, scattered words in text may be hypertext links that are
               marked as such by being printed in a different color. This technique describes a way
               to provide cues in addition to color so that users who may have difficulty perceiving
               color differences or have low vision can identify them.
            </p>
            <p>To use this technique, an author incorporates a visual cue in addition to color for
               each place where color alone is used to convey information. Visual cues can take many
               forms including changes to the font style, the addition of underlines, bold, or italics,
               or changes to the font size.

               <div>
                  
                  <p>While this technique is sufficient to meet the visual requirements of Success Criterion
                     1.4.1, the information conveyed by the color must also be available programmatically
                     to satisfy Success Criterion 1.3.1. See
                     <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships">How to Meet 1.3.1</a>.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>The default formatting for links on a page includes presenting them both in a different
                  color than the other text on the page underlining them to make the links identifiable
                  even without color vision.
               </li>
               
               <li>An article comparing the use of similar elements in different markup languages uses
                  colored text to identify the elements from each language. Elements from the first
                  markup language are identified using BLUE, bolded text. Elements from the second are
                  presented as RED, italicized text.
               </li>
               
               <li>A news site lists links to the articles appearing on its site. Additional information
                  such as the section the article appears in, the time the article was posted, a related
                  location or an indication that it is accompanied by live video appears in some cases.
                  The links to the articles are in a different color than the additional information
                  but the links are not underlined, and each link is presented in a larger font than
                  the rest of the information so that users who have problems distinguishing between
                  colors can identify the links more easily.
               </li>
               
               <li>Short news items sometimes have sentences that are also links to more information.
                  Those sentences are printed in color and use a sans-serif font face while the rest
                  of the paragraph is in black Times-Roman.
