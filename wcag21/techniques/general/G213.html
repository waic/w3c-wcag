         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

         <section id="applicability">
            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Use this technique on web pages that detect device or user motion such as shaking
               or tilting and use this motion as a means of input.  If the motion itself is essential
               to the application's function, then this technique does not apply.
            </p>
            <p>This technique also does not relate to movement of users through space as registered
               by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional
               gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating
               a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.
            </p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that:</p>
            <ol>
               				
               <li>People who use mounted devices or who cannot precisely manipulate a device are able
                  to provide inputs through more conventional user interface components, and
               </li>
               				
               <li>People who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments
                  have the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering
                  of functions.
               </li>
               			
            </ol>
            <p>When a device sensor such as an accelerometer or gyroscope is used to gather input:</p>
            <ol>
               				
               <li>A button, link, or other conventional control is provided that does not rely on sensor
                  input, and
               </li>
               				
               <li>A setting is provided to allow the user to turn off the sensor data.</li>

               <h3>Example 1: Shake to undo</h3>
               <p>After text is entered in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to
                  undo the entry. Supporting use of the backspace key and/or providing a clear button
                  next to the text field offers the same functionality.
               </p>
               <p>Shake to undo can be turned off in a settings page.</p>

               <h3>Example 2: Motion Activated Slider</h3>
               <p>A slider can be adjusted by tipping the device to the left and right. There are also
                  buttons to achieve the same functionality, and a tick-box that prevents the motion
                  from having an effect.
