         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to help orient the user by providing information
               about the current location via the navigational user interface component. This technique
               is especially useful when the Web pages are steps in a task that must be processed
               in order. Providing this indication helps the user to better understand his place
               in the sequence. The location may be indicated by adding an icon or text, or by changing
               the state of the item.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>A Web page implements tab panel style navigation. A list of panel tabs is displayed
                  horizontally across the page. The current content is displayed in a panel below the
                  list of panel tabs. When the user navigates to and selects a particular panel tab
                  the content in the panel is updated to reflect the topic of the selected tab. In addition,
                  the background color of the selected tab is changed from the default color and a check
                  mark icon is displayed next to the tab panel text to indicate it is the active panel.
                  The check mark icon includes an appropriate text alternative.

               <h3>Example 2</h3>
               <p>The layout for a Web page uses a frameset and frames. One of the frames is designated
                  as the navigation frame and another frame displays the content of the Web site. When
                  the user selects a link in the navigation frame, the information related to the link
                  is displayed within the content frame. The text for the selected item in the navigation
                  frame is updated with an asterisk character to indicate that it is the selected topic.

               <h3>Example 3</h3>
               <p>The navigation bar for a site is implemented as a list of links. The navigation bar
                  appears on all Web pages within a collection of Web pages. As the user gives focus
                  to or hovers over a particular link in the navigation bar the background color of
                  the link is changed. This change in styling on mouseover or focus is specified via
                  the cascading style sheet for the Web page. When focus is removed from the link the
                  style is reset to the normal link style. When the link is activated to change the
                  contents of the page, the selected link within the navigation bar is disabled since
                  the result of following this link is the Web page currently being displayed. Changing
                  the background color gives sighted users visual notification of the link to be selected.
                  Disabling the link provides information to all users that it is the currently selected
                  topic.
