            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Appropriate to use for all general Web content including special cases like material
               that is specifically designed for a display in a foyer.
            </p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold">Success Criterion 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an easy way to pass the success criterion
               for things that flash, but are small.
            </p>
            <p>If you have something that flashes
               <em>more</em>
               than 3 times in a one second period (so G19 can't be used), but the area that is flashing
               is less than 25% of 10 degrees of visual field (which represents the central area
               of vision in the eye), then it would automatically pass.
            </p>
            <p>The 10 degree of visual field represents the central area of vision in the eye. This
               area is highly packed with visual sensors. Flashes in this area are transmitted to
               the visual cortex. For those with photosensitivity, this flashing of activity on the
               visual cortex can cause seizures. Flashing on other areas of the eye (which have far
               fewer sensors) has much less effect on the cortex. Hence, the focus on just the 10
               degrees of central vision.
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>If the content is for general Web use, you can use
                  <a href="#smallsafe1">Formula 1: Small Safe Area for Web Content</a>.
               </li>
               
               <li>If the content is for a known display (e.g., in a company foyer) then
                  <a href="#smallsafe2">Formula 2: Small Safe Area for Known Displays</a>
                  should be used.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p id="smallsafe1">
               <strong>Formula 1: Small Safe Area for Web Content</strong>
               
            </p>
            <p>Most Web authors do not know how to translate visual field to pixels, which is what
               they generally can deal with. This technique provides that translation.
            </p>
            <p>At this point in time, the most prevalent display is 1024 x 768 and about 15-17 inches
               diagonally. When viewed at a typical viewing distance (22-26 inches) a 10 degree visual
               field will capture an area approximately 341 x 256 pixels. This is not circular, but
               neither is the central vision of most users, and the difference is so small (and at
               the edge of the central vision where sensors are fewer) that it is not important.
            </p>
            <p>Since the criterion is 25% of any 10 degree visual field,
               <strong>any single flashing event on a screen (there is no other flashing on screen) that
                  is smaller than a contiguous area of 21,824 sq pixels (any shape), would pass the
                  General and Red Flash Thresholds</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>1024 x 768 was chosen because it represents the most common screen size. It also works
               with higher resolution screens since the tighter pixel density would result in a smaller
               and safer image size.
            </p>
            <p>Users with lower resolution displays or that enlarge or view their screens closely
               would have a higher risk depending on the viewing distance. To address the needs of
               this group,
               <a href="#G19"></a>
               should be used since it is independent of screen resolution or viewing distance.

            <p>To calculate the
               <em>small safe area</em>
               (in pixels) on the screen when the screen size, resolution, and viewing distance is
               known, use the following procedure.

                  <p>For a number of reasons (distribution of central vision sensors often non-circular,
                     simplicity, computational convenience, historical), a 4:3 rectangular approximation
                     of the central 10 degree of visual field is used that is 10 degrees wide and 7.5 degrees
                     high. This has an area of 75 square degrees, vs the 78.5 square degree area of a true
                     circle of 10 degrees.

               <li>To convert viewing distance to rectangle size, multiply the viewing distance by 0.1745
                  (10 * Pi / 180) to get the width of the rectangle, and multiply the viewing distance
                  by 0.1309 (7.5 * Pi / 180) to get the height of the rectangle. (This calculation can
                  be done in inches, or millimeters, or any other unit of length.)

                     of the screen, in pixels per unit length, to get the horizontal and vertical size

                     <li>For a 720p widescreen display (which is usually 1365 by 768 pixels), the resolution
                        of the screen in pixels per inch is 1566 divided by the diagonal screen size, in inches.

                     <li>For an LCD computer monitor which specifies the pixel pitch in millimeters / pixel,
                        the resolution of the screen in pixels per inch is 25.4 divided by the pixel pitch
                        in millimeters.

                  <p>For any display, if you know the actual diagonal screen size in inches, and the horizontal
                     and vertical resolution of the display in pixels, then the resolution of the screen
                     in pixels per inch is the square-root of ( (horizontal resolution in pixels) * (horizontal

               <li>An author creates an animation that will be displayed on a screen in the entrance
                  lounge at a company. Using the size and resolution of the display and the closest
                  distance that a person can stand when viewing the display, they calculate the size
                  of 25% of the 10 degree of central vision in pixels (using the formula above). This
                  would be the
                  <em>small safe area</em>. They then are careful to never flash any area larger than the
