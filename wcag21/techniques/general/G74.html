         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <p>Applies to all technologies</p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a long description without
               requiring the user to jump off to another location for the description. It
               also allows all users to see the description which may be useful to anyone
               who might miss some features in the non-text content.
            </p>
            <p>With this technique, the long description is provided as part of the
               standard presentation (i.e., everyone receives it). The description is
               located near the non-text content but does not have to be the very next
               item. For example, there may be a caption under a chart with the long
               description provided in the following paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>The location of this long description is then provided within the short text
               alternative so the user knows where to look for it if they cannot view the
               non-text content.

               <p>There is a bar chart on a Web page showing the sales for the top
                  three salespeople.
               </p>
               <p>The short text alternative says: "October sales chart for top three
                  salespeople. Details in text following the chart:"

               <p>The following is in the paragraph immediately below the chart. "Sales for October
                  show Mary leading with 400 units. Mike follows closely with 389. Chris rounds out
                  our top 3 with sales of 350."
