            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide information to users about
               what will happen when a change to a form control results in a change of
               context. Because changing the value of a form control does not typically
               result in a change of context, it is important that authors provide
               instructions that make the user aware of the behavior in advance. Where
               possible, it is a good idea to programmatically associate the instructions
               describing the change with the form control itself.
            </p>
            <p>The following are some examples of how to provide the instruction in different situations.</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Provide instruction on the Web page with reading order that precedes the user interface
                  element that causes change of context by change of setting.
               </li>
               
               <li>For a multi-step process where users must complete particular steps in order to reach
                  the user interface element where changes of setting would cause a change of context,
                  provide the instruction as part of the process prior to the step where they would
                  encounter the change of context.
               </li>
               
               <li>In the case of an intranet where user training is required prior to the use of a Web
                  application where user interface elements that cause changes of context when settings
                  are changed, instruction is provided as part of the training.

            <ul>
               
               <li>A series of radio buttons at the top of a page include
                  options for German, French and Spanish. Instructions precede
                  the buttons that instruct the user that the language will be
                  changed upon selecting an option.
               </li>
               
               <li>A 50 question online survey displays one question at a time.
                  Instructions appear at the beginning of the survey that
                  explain that users will be taken to the next question of the
                  survey upon selecting an answer to each question.
