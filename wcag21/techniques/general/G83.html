            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to notify the user when a field that must be completed
               has not been completed. When users fail to provide input for any mandatory form fields,
               information is provided in text to enable the users to identify which fields were
               omitted. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an alert dialog
               box identifying the mandatory fields which were omitted. Another approach, using server-side
               validation, is to re-display the form (including any  previously entered data), with
               either a text description at the location of the omitted mandatory field, or a text
               description that identifies the omitted mandatory fields.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>The best practice is to include a message or alert, as some users may not be aware
                     that an error has occurred and could assume that the form is not functioning correctly.
                     It is also best practice to include an error notification in the page title (<code class="el">title</code> element) since a screen reader user is likely to believe the page was submitted correctly
                     and continue to navigate to another page as soon as the new page is returned instead
                     of reading the main content area of the page again.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A user attempts to submit a form but has neglected to provide input or select a choice
                  in one or more mandatory fields. Using client-side validation, the omission is detected
                  and an alert dialog appears informing the user that mandatory fields have not been
                  completed. The labels of the fields with this problem are changed to identify the
                  problem field, and links to the problem fields are inserted in the document after
                  the submit button so the user can move to them after dismissing the alert.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user attempts to submit a form but has neglected to provide input or select a choice
                  in one or more mandatory fields. Using server-side validation, the omission is detected
                  and the form is re-displayed with a text description at the top informing which mandatory
                  fields were omitted. Each omitted mandatory field is also identified using a text
                  label so that the user does not have to return to the list at the top of the form
                  to find the omitted fields.

               <li>
                  
                  <p>A user is completing a form that contains mandatory fields.  The labels of the fields
                     indicate whether or not they are mandatory.  The user tabs to a mandatory field, and
                     tabs out of the field without entering any data or selecting a choice.  A client-side
                     script modifies the label of the field to indicate that leaving it blank was an error.
