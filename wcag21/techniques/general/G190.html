         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>It is better for all objects on a page to conform, but there are certain circumstances
               where that may not be possible. There may be situations when an object or section
               of content targets people with certain disabilities while those same attributes make
               it inaccessible for someone else. There may also be other reasons not to have a conforming
               object on the Web page. When an object does not conform, then a link to a conforming
               alternate version is adjacent to the non-conforming object in the linear reading order
               or is associated with the the non-conforming content. The conforming alternate version
               conveys the same information as the non-conforming version.

               <h3>Example 1: A video of a rap song where audio descriptions would interfere with the
                  artistic integrity of the music
               </h3>
               <p>A video of a rap song named "The Hip Hop Kid" has a musical background. Introducing
                  "Audio Description" speaking parts during the pauses in the song would interfere with
                  the guitar lines and drum grooves that the artist is trying to convey. On the Web
                  page, immediately following the video object, there is a link that says, "Audio described
                  version of 'The hip hop kid'" which contains a version of the video containing audio
                  descriptions of what is happening visually in the video.

               <h3>Example 2: An image of a historical document</h3>
               <p>A Web page about the Declaration of Independence contains an image of the document.
                  There is not sufficient contrast between the text and the background, and the handwriting
                  on the document is difficult to read. A link takes the user to an HTML version of
                  the document.
