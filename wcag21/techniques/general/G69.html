            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting
               the information in a synchronized media presentation.
            </p>
            <p>In a synchronized media presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways
               including:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>dialogue,</li>
               
               <li>sounds (natural and artificial),</li>
               
               <li>the setting and background,</li>
               
               <li>the actions and expressions of people, animals, etc.,</li>
               
               <li>text or graphics,</li>
               
               <li>and more.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves
               creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information as
               the synchronized media.  Such a document is sometimes called a screenplay. It includes
               all the important dialogue and actions as well as descriptions of backgrounds etc.
               that are part of the story.
            </p>
            <p>If an actual screenplay was used to create the synchronized media in the first place,
               this can be a good place to start.  In production and editing however, the synchronized
               media usually changes from the screenplay.  For this technique, the original screenplay
               would be corrected to match the dialogue and what actually happens in the final edited
               form of the synchronized media.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, some special types of synchronized media include interaction that has
               to occur at particular places in the playing of the synchronized media.   Sometimes
               it may result in an action taking place (e.g., something is purchased, sent, done,
               etc.). Sometimes it may change the course of the synchronized media (e.g., the synchronized
               media has multiple paths that are determined by user input).  In those cases links
               or some other mechanism would be used in the alternative for time-based media to allow
               people using the alternative to be able to have the same options and abilities as
               those using the synchronized media.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A training film shows employees how to use a new piece of equipment.  It involves
                  a person talking throughout while they demonstrate the operation.  The screenplay
                  used to create the training film is used as a starting point. It is then edited and
                  corrected to match the dialogue etc.  The film and the resulting alternative for time-based
                  media are then made available on the company Web site. Employees can then use either
                  or both to learn how to use the machine.
               </li>
               
               <li>An interactive shopping environment is created that allows users to steer themselves
                  around in a virtual store and shop.  An alternative for time-based media allows the
                  users to access the same shopping in text with links to choose aisles and to purchase
                  things instead of dragging them into a virtual shopping basket.
