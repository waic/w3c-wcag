            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Programming technologies that have standard components programmed to interface with
               accessibility APIs.
            </p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a> (Sufficient using a more specific technique)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
               understand Web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
               user through an alternate user interface.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes content is not created using markup language but rather using a
               programming language or tools. In many cases, these technologies have
               interface components that are already programmed to interface with
               accessibility APIs. If an author uses these components and fills in the
               properties (e.g., name, etc.), the resulting user interface components in the
               content will be accessible to assistive technology.
            </p>
            <p>However, if an author wants to create a user interface component that is new
               and they cannot use standard components, then they need to be sure to add
               the accessibility provisions themselves - and implement them in a way that
               is compatible with the accessibility API.
            </p>
            <p>After completion, the custom component should be tested for Accessibility Support.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A Web page uses java to create an applet. A group of
                  authors wants to create an entirely new type of interface component
                  so they cannot use existing Java objects. They use Java swing classes
                  to create their component because the Java swing classes already
                  have provisions for connecting to different accessibility APIs.
                  Using the Java swing classes they are able to create an interface
                  component that exposes its name and role, is able to be set by AT
                  and alerts AT to any updates.
               </li>
               
               <li>A Web page uses an original ActiveX control that is
                  written in the C++ programming language. The control is written to
                  explicitly support the Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) API to
                  expose information about accept commands. The control then interacts
                  directly with assistive technology running the user agent on systems
                  that support MSAA.
