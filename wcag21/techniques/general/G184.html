            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to help the user avoid input errors by informing
               them ahead of time about restrictions on the format of data that they must enter.
               Instructions on such restrictions are provided at the top of forms. This technique
               works best for forms that have a small number of fields or those where many form fields
               require data in the same format. In these cases, it is more efficient to describe
               the format once in instructions at the top of the form rather than repeating the same
               information for each field that has the same restricted format requirement.

               <p>A business networking site allows users to post descriptions of jobs they have held.
                  The form to gather the information includes fields for the company name, job title,
                  from and to dates, and job description. At the top of the form are the following instructions:

               <p>A corporate directory allows users to customize information such as telephone number
                  and job responsibilities by editing their profile. At the top of the form are the
