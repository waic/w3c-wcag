         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to help  users with cognitive disabilities, blindness
               and vision loss to understand what will happen when they interact with a function
               on a Web page. If there are different labels on user interface components (i.e., elements,
               links, JavaScript objects, etc.) that have the same function, the user will not know
               that they have encountered a component with the same function and will not know what
               to expect. This could lead to many unnecessary errors. It is also recommended that
               this approach to consistent labelling be applied across the Web site.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A Web page has a form field at the top of the page labeled "Search". On the bottom
                  of the page is another form field which provides the same function. It is also labeled
                  "Search."
               </li>
               
               <li>A picture of a question mark is used to steer users to sections of the page that provide
                  additional information. Each time the picture of the question mark appears it has
                  the same text alternative "more information."

               <li>A link to the Contact Us page of a Web site has the link text "Contact". At the bottom
                  of the page there is a link that also goes to the Contact Us page. It also has the
                  link text "Contact".
