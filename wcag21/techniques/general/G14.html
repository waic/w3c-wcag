         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that when color differences are used
               to convey information, such as required form fields, the information conveyed by the
               color differences are also conveyed explicitly in text.

               <h3>Example 1: A color-coded schedule</h3>
               <p>The schedule for sessions at a technology conference is organized into three tracks.
                  Sessions for Track 1 are displayed over a blue background. Sessions in Track 2 are
                  displayed over a yellow background. Sessions in Track 3 are displayed on a green background.
                  After the name of each session is a code identifying the track in text: T1 for Track
                  1, T2 for Track 2, and T3 for Track 3.

               <p>The schedule for sessions at a technology conference is organized into three tracks.
                  Next to the title of each session is an icon consisting of a colored circle with a
                  number in the middle showing what track it belongs to: blue circles with the number
                  1 represent track 1, yellow circles with the number 2 represent Track 2, and green
                  circles with the number 3 represent Track 3. Each icon is associated with a text alternative
                  reading "Track 1," "Track 2," or "Track 3," as appropriate.

               <h3>Example 3: A form with required fields</h3>
               <p>A form contains several required fields. The labels for the required fields are displayed
                  in red. In addition, at the end of each label is an asterisk character, *. The instructions
                  for completing the form indicate that "all required fields are displayed in red and
                  marked with an asterisk *", followed by an example.

                        difficult for users with low vision because they are rendered in a smaller size than
                        default text. It is important for authors to include the text indicating that asterisk
                        is used and to consider increasing the size of the asterisk that is presented.

               <p>An on-line loan application explains that green buttons advance in the process and
                  red buttons cancel the process. A form contains a green button containing the text
                  <em>Go</em>. The instructions say "Press the button labeled
                  <em>Go</em>
                  to submit your results and proceed to the next step."
