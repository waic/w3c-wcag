         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Web servers that require user authentication often terminate the session after a set
               period of time if there is no activity from the user. If the user is unable to input
               the data quickly enough and the session times out before they submit, the server will
               require re-authentication before proceeding. When this happens, the server passes
               (as hidden data) the information from the form into the page that is used for re-authentication.
               Then, when the user re-authenticates, the server can use the information passed on
               from the re-authentication page to submit the form directly or to present a page that
               includes the data that is to be submitted for review. In this technique, the server
               does not have to store any user-submitted data on server. This is an important technique
               for those cases where it is either illegal or a security risk for the server to store
               information temporarily. It also is useful in that it frees the server from having
               to maintain the stored information and reconnect it with the newly authenticated session.

                  <p>If the data users are submitting is sensitive or presents a security risk, authors
                     should consider the process used to pass the data to the re-authentication page and,
                     after re-authentication, to the page that will process the original data in order
                     to ensure that the data is protected.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A user has logged in to use a wiki and begins editing a page. The time taken to complete
                  the edits exceeds the time allowed by the server for session inactivity. When the
                  user submits the edits, the user is notified that the session has timed out and is
                  redirected to a login page. The script that handles the original form submission passes
                  the edits as a variable to the login page and when the user successfully logs in,
                  passes the users edits back to the script that handles form submissions and the edits
                  are processed as though no session timeout had occurred.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user had logged in to a secure shopping site and fills out some of the information
                  on an order form. For security reasons, the session times out after 30 mintues, but
                  the user does not submit the form until 45 minutes after loading the page. The user
                  is informed of the time out and is prompted to log-in again. If the user logs in correctly,
                  the order form is presented to the user with all of the data previously entered and
                  the user is able to review their submission and submit the form. If the log-in is
                  not successfully completed, then the form data is discarded by the server.
