            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to help users find input errors where the information
               supplied by the user is not accepted. This includes fields with missing required information
               and fields with incorrect information. When users enter data input that is checked,
               and input errors are detected, a link to that error is provided so that the user does
               not have to search for it. One approach is to use server-side validation, and to re-display
               the form (including any previously entered data), and a text description at the top
               of the page that indicates the fact that there was an input error, describes the nature
               of the problem, and provides a link the field(s) with a problem.

               <h3>Example 1: Server-side error checking</h3>
               <p>The user inputs invalid data on a form field and submits the form. The server returns
                  the form, with the user's data still present, and indicates clearly in text at the
                  top of the page that there were not accepted. The text describes the nature of the
                  error(s) and provides a link to the field that had the problem so the user can easily
                  navigate to it to fix the problem.

               <h3>Example 2: Client-side error checking with a popup</h3>
               <p>The user inputs invalid data on a form field and attempts to submit the form. Client-side
                  scripting detects the error, cancels the submit, and modifies the document to provide
                  a text message describing the error, with links to the field(s) with the error. The
                  script also modifies the labels of the fields with the problems to highlight them.

               <h3>Example 3: Client-side error checking with no popup</h3>
               <p>When the user submits a form, instead of taking them to a new page, a script automatically
                  sets focus to a text link that says "Errors have occurred." The link goes to the first
                  item in an ordered list of descriptive error messages. Each list item is a link to
                  the control where the error had occurred. And there is a link from the error back
                  to the ordered list of descriptive error messages. The process is repeated as needed.
