         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Any technology that supports pointer input (e.g., supporting any or all of the following:
               mouse pointer, touch on touch screen or trackpad, stylus input, or laser pointer input).

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who have difficulties performing
               path-based gestures can operate a content slider with a single pointer (e.g., a single
               tap on a touch screen or a single mouse click). A content slider contains chunks of
               content in a row. Usually several chunks of content are hidden, and only one chunk
               is visible at any time. Left and right horizontal swiping over the visible part of
               the slider brings adjacent hidden chunks of content into view. Providing controls
               (for example, arrow buttons) as alternative means of input allows advancing the slider
               with single pointer input.

               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based gestures usually do not work when
                  OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader are turned on. This
                  is because AT generally consumes a path-based gestures so they would not reach the
                  authored content. For example, a horizontal swipe gesture over the content slider
                  will not work as intended by the author, but move the screen reader focus to the next
                  or previous element. Some gestures may work if the user operates "pass-through gestures"
                  which are often unreliable as they may depend on factors of hardware, operating system,
                  operating system "skin", operating system setting, or user agent.

               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>This technique addresses gestures where support has been implemented by authors, not
                  gestures provided by the user agent (such as horizontal swiping to move through the
                  browser history or vertical swiping to scroll through page content) or the operating
                  system (e.g., gestures to move between open apps, or call up contextual menus of assistive
                  technologies when these are enabled).
