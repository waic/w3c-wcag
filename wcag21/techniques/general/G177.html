         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to suggest correct text where the information supplied
               by the user is not accepted and possible correct text is known. The suggestions may
               include correct spelling or similar text from a known pool of possible text.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the form, suggestions could be located next to the field where the error
               was identified, elsewhere on the page or via a search mechanism or reference where
               results would be listed on another URI. Where possible, suggestions for correction
               should be incorporated in a way that is easy for the user. For example, an incorrect
               submission may return a list of possible corrections where the user can select a checkbox
               or radio button to indicate which option was intended. Suggestions or links to the
               suggestions should be placed close to the form fields they are associated with, such
               as at the top of the form, preceding the form fields, or next to the form fields requiring
               correction.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A form field requires the user to input a length of time that could range from days
                  to years. The user enters the number "6". The server returns the form as the user
                  had submitted it and also includes a suggested text next to the form field: "Error
                  detected. Did you mean: 6 days, 6 weeks, 6 months or 6 years?"
               </li>
               
               <li>The user enters an incorrectly spelled city name. The server returns the form as the
                  user had submitted it and also includes a message at the top of the form informing
                  the user of the error and a link to a list of city names that the user may have meant,
                  as determined by comparing their original input to a database of city names.
               </li>
               
               <li>A bus route trip planner allows users to enter their origin an destination, allowing
                  users to enter street addresses, intersections and city landmarks. When a user enters
                  "Kohl," they are prompted with a list of search results with similar matches that
                  reads, "Your search for 'Kohl' returned the following". A select box follows the prompt
                  lists, "Kohl Center," "Kohl's Dept. Store-East" and "Kohl's Dept. Store-West" as options
                  the user can choose from.
               </li>
               
               <li>A search runs a spell check on input and provides a link of alternatives if a spelling
                  error is detected. When the user clicks on the link, the search is automatically resubmitted
                  with the correct spelling.
