         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The intent of this technique is to allow a user to turn off sounds that start automatically
               when a page loads. The control to turn off the sounds should be located near the beginning
               of the page to allow the control to be easily and quickly discovered by users. This
               is useful for those who utilize assistive technologies (such as screen readers, screen
               magnifiers, switch mechanisms, etc.) and those who may not (such as those with cognitive,
               learning and language disabilities).
            </p>
            <p>In this technique, an author includes a control that makes it possible for users to
               turn off any sounds that are played automatically. The control should be keyboard
               operable, located early in the tab and reading order, and clearly labeled to indicate
               that it will turn off the sounds that are playing.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>A Web page contains a time-based media presentation that includes an audio track as
                  well as an animated video describing how to repair a lawnmower engine. The page contains
                  2 buttons that say "Pause" and "Stop", which give the user control over when and if
                  the time-based media plays.

               <p>A Web page contains an embedded short film. The page contains a button that says "Pause
                  the movie", which allows the user to pause the film.

                  and audio from playing.
