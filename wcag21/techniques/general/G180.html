         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to give people with disabilities enough time to
               complete tasks which may take them longer than someone without those challenges. Some
               mechanism such as a preference setting or a control on the page lets the user change
               the time limits to at least 10 times the default time limit. Preferably, the mechanism
               would have a variable adjustment that lets the user change the time limit to any value
               in its range, but could also provide ways to change the time limit by discrete increments.
               The user changes the time limit at the beginning of his session, before any activity
               that has a time limit.

            <ul>
               
               <li>An airline has an online ticket purchasing application. By default, the application
                  has a 1 minute time limit for each step of the purchase process. At the beginning
                  of the session, a Web page includes information that says, "We expect that each step
                  in the purchasing process will take users one minute to complete. Would you like to
                  adjust the time limit?" followed by several radio buttons "1 minute, 2 minutes, 5
                  minutes, 10 minutes."
               </li>
               
               <li>A Web based email application automatically logs users out when there has been no
                  activity for 30 minutes. The application includes a preference that allows users to
                  adjust the amount of time to any value.
