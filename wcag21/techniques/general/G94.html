            <p>Applies to all technologies.</p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to create a text alternative that serves the same
               purpose and presents the same information as the original non-text content.  As a
               result, it is possible to remove the non-text content and replace it with the text
               alternative and no functionality or information would be lost.   This text alternative
               should not necessarily describe the non-text content.  It should serve the same purpose
               and convey the same information.  This may sometimes result in a text alternative
               that looks like a description of the non-text content.  But this would only be true
               if that was the best way to serve the same purpose.
            </p>
            <p>If possible, the short text alternative should completely convey the purpose and information.
               If it is not possible to do this in a short phrase or sentence, then the short text
               alternative should provide a brief overview of the information.  A long text alternative
               would be used in addition to convey the full information.
            </p>
            <p>The text alternative should be able to substitute for the non-text content. If the
               non-text content were removed from the page and substituted with the text, the page
               would still provide the same function and information. The text alternative would
               be brief but as informative as possible.
            </p>
            <p>In deciding what text to include in the alternative, it is often a good idea to consider
               the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Why is this non-text content here?</li>
               
               <li>What information is it presenting?</li>
               
               <li>What purpose does it fulfill?</li>
               
               <li>If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to convey the same
                  function and/or information?
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>When non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content,
               the alt text should include those words. If the text in the image is more than can
               fit in a short text alternative then it should be described in the short text alternative
               and a long text alternative should be provided as well with the complete text.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A search button uses an image of a magnifying glass.  The text alternative is "search"
                  and not "magnifying glass".
               </li>
               
               <li>A picture shows how a knot is tied including arrows showing how the ropes go to make
                  the knot.  The text alternative describes how to tie the knot, not what the picture
                  looks like.
               </li>
               
               <li>A picture shows what a toy looks like from the front.  The text alternative describes
                  a front view of the toy.
               </li>
               
               <li>An animation shows how to change a tire. A short text alternative describes what the
                  animation is about. A long text alternative describes how to change a tire.
               </li>
               
               <li>A logo of the TechTron company appears next to each product in a list that is made
                  by that and has a short text alternative that reads, "TechTron."
               </li>
               
               <li>A chart showing sales for October has an short text alternative of  "October sales
                  chart". It also has a long description that provides all of the information on the
                  chart.
               </li>
               
               <li>A heading contains a picture of the words, "The History of War" in stylized text.
                  The alt text for the picture is "The History of War".
               </li>
               
               <li>An image of a series of books on a shelf contains interactive areas
                  that provide the navigation means to a Web page about the particular book. The
                  text alternative "The books available to buy in this section. Select a book for
                  more details about that book." describes the picture and the interactive
                  nature.
