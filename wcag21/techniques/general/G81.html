         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Applies to all synchronized media technologies that allow synchronization of
               multiple video streams
            </p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/sign-language-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.6: Sign Language (Prerecorded)</a> (Sufficient using a more specific technique)</span>.

         <section id="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear or read
               text rapidly to be able to access synchronized media material without affecting the
               presentation of the material for all viewers.
            </p>
            <p>For those who communicate primarily in sign language it is sometimes less
               preferable and sometimes not possible for them to read and understand text
               at the rate it is presented in captions. For these latter individuals it is
               important to provide sign language presentation of the audio information.
            </p>
            <p>This technique accomplishes this by providing the sign language
               interpretation as a separate video stream that is synchronized with the
               original video stream. Depending on the player, this secondary video stream
               can be overlaid on top of the original video or displayed in a separate
               window. It may also be possible to enlarge the sign language interpreter
               separately from the original video to make it easier to read the hand, body
               and facial movements of the signer.
            </p>
            <p>NOTE: Since sign language is not usually a signed version of the printed
               language, the author has to decide which sign language to include. Usually
               the sign language of the primary audience would be used. If intended for
               multiple audiences, multiple languages may be used. See advisory technique
               for multiple sign languages.
