         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to make content easier to use by making
               the placement of repeated components more predictable. This technique helps
               maintain consistent layout or presentation between Web pages by presenting components
               that are repeated in these Web  units in the same relative order each time they appear.
               Other
               components can be inserted between them, but their relative order is not
               changed.
            </p>
            <p>This technique also applies to navigational components that are repeated.
               Web pages often contain a navigation menu or other
               navigational component that allows the user to jump to other Web pages. This technique
               makes the placement of navigational
               components more predictable by presenting the links or programmatic
               references inside a navigational component in the same relative order each
               time the navigational component is repeated. Other links can be removed or
               inserted between the existing ones, for example to allow navigation inside a
               subsection of a set of Web pages, but the relative order is not
               changed.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A Web site has a logo, a title, a search form and a navigation bar
                  at the top of each page; these appear in the same relative order on
                  each page where they are repeated. On one page the search form is
                  missing but the other items are still in the same order.
               </li>
               
               <li>A Web site has a left-hand navigation menu with links to the major
                  sections of the site. When the user follows a link to another
                  section of the site, the links to the major sections appear in the
                  same relative order in the next page. Sometime links are dropped and
                  other links are added, but the other links always stay in the same
                  relative order. For example, on a Web site of a company that sells
                  products and offers training, when a user moves from the section on
                  products to the section on training, the links to individual
                  products are removed from the navigation list, while links to
                  training offerings are added.
