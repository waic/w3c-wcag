            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Before graphics became widely used on the internet, ASCII characters were often arranged
               to form pictures or graphs. Although ASCII art is not used frequently on the Web anymore,
               it must be remembered that, when it is used, it is very confusing to people who are
               blind and accessing the internet using screen readers. If it is used it should also
               have a text explanation of what the picture is. It is also suggested that there be
               a link to skip over the ASCII art (although this is not required).
            </p>
            <p>Emoticons are very popular. They include ASCII characters that form facial expressions
               and other ways to communicate an emotion. They can be confusing for screen reader
               users. When possible it is better simply to use a word like "smile" instead of an
               emoticon. But if emoticons are used they should have a text alternative. In some contexts,
               blog and forum software for example, plug-ins are available that automatically convert
               ASCII characters used as emoticons into HTML images with text alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>Leetspeak uses various combinations of characters, including numerals and special
               characters, to replace standard characters. Leet has become a part of Internet culture
               and slang. Leet is frequently used to beat text and spam filters. It is often incomprehensible
               to blind people using screen readers, and therefore requires a text alternative in
               order to conform to Success Criteria 1.1.1.

               <div>
                  
                  <p>Because support for this technique is limited, it is recommended that authors provide
                     the text alternative in text.
